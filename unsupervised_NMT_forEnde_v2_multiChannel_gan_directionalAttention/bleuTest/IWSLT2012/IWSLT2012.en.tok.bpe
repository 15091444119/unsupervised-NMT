Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
Do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
I recently did a survey with over 2@@ ,000 Americans , and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about 70 in a typical day .
There was also recently a study done with CE@@ Os in which they followed CE@@ Os around for a whole week .
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these CE@@ Os engaged in and how much time they spent eng@@ aging in making decisions related to these tasks .
And they found that the average CEO engaged in about 13@@ 9 tasks in a week .
Each task was made up of many , many , many sub-@@ choices of course .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
Only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
Th@@ ink about your own choices .
Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category ver@@ sus your one hour category ?
How well do you think you &apos;re doing at managing those choices ?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have , which is the choice over@@ load problem .
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
Now as I talk about this problem , I &apos;m going to have some questions for you and I &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
So when I ask you a question , since I &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some cal@@ ories .
Otherwise , when I ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , I &apos;d like you to cl@@ ap your hands .
So for my first question for you today : Are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ load problem ?
Thank you .
So when I was a graduate student at Stan@@ ford University , I used to go to this very , very up@@ scale gro@@ cer@@ y store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
It was a store called Dra@@ eger &apos;s .
Now this store , it was almost like going to an am@@ us@@ ement park .
They had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and vin@@ eg@@ ars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of bot@@ tled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink t@@ ap water .
I used to love going to this store , but on one occasion I asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
Here &apos;s their olive oil a@@ is@@ le .
They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those that were in a locked case that came from thous@@ and-@@ year-old olive trees .
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager , and I asked the manager , &quot; Is this model of offering people all this choice really working ? &quot;
And he pointed to the bus@@ loads of tourists that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
We decided to do a little experiment , and we picked j@@ am for our experiment .
Here &apos;s their j@@ am a@@ is@@ le .
They had 3@@ 48 different kinds of j@@ am .
We set up a little ta@@ sting booth right near the entrance of the store .
We there put out six different fla@@ vors of j@@ am or 24 different fla@@ vors of j@@ am , and we looked at two things : First , in which case were people more likely to stop , sample some j@@ am ?
More people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
Now we see the opposite effect .
Of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
Of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
Now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am if they encountered six than if they encountered 24 .
Now choosing not to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ ist@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affects us even in very consequ@@ ential decisions .
We choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self-@@ interests .
So now for the topic of today : financial savings .
Now I &apos;m going to describe to you a study I did with G@@ ur Hu@@ ber@@ man , E@@ mir Kam@@ en@@ ica , W@@ ei J@@ ang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 650 plans all in the U.S.
And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offer@@ ings available in a retirement savings plan , the 4@@ 01 plan , does that affect people &apos;s lik@@ el@@ ihood to save more for tomorrow .
And what we found was that indeed there was a cor@@ relation .
So in these plans , we had about 6@@ 57 plans that ran@@ ged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offer@@ ings .
And what we found was that , the more funds offered , indeed , there was less participation rate .
So if you look at the extrem@@ es , those plans that offered you two funds , participation rates were around in the mid-@@ 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds , participation rates have now dropped to about the 60@@ th perc@@ enti@@ le .
Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
So for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds .
The more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts .
Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you &apos;re considering their future financial well-being .
Well , over the past decade , we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices .
They &apos;re more likely to delay choosing -- proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ate even when it goes against their best self-@@ interest .
They &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
They &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied , even when they do obj@@ ectively better .
The main reason for this is because , we might enjoy g@@ az@@ ing at those giant walls of may@@ onn@@ a@@ ises , mu@@ star@@ ds , vin@@ eg@@ ars , j@@ ams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contra@@ sting and actually pic@@ king from that stunning display .
So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
The first : C@@ ut .
You &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
People are always up@@ set when I say , &quot; C@@ ut . &quot;
They &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shel@@ f space .
But in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous redundant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a lower@@ ing of costs , there is an improvement of the choosing experience .
When Proc@@ tor &amp; amp ; Gam@@ ble went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; amp ; Sh@@ oul@@ ders to 15 , they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent .
When the Golden C@@ at Corporation got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling cat lit@@ ter products , they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and lower@@ ing of costs .
You know , the average gro@@ cer@@ y store today offers you 45@@ ,000 products .
The typical Wal@@ mar@@ t today offers you 100@@ ,000 products .
But the nin@@ th largest retail@@ er , the nin@@ th biggest retail@@ er in the world today is Al@@ di , and it offers you only 1,@@ 400 products -- one kind of c@@ ann@@ ed tom@@ ato sau@@ ce .
Now in the financial savings world , I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offer@@ ings has actually been something that David La@@ i@@ b@@ son was heavily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at Harv@@ ard .
Every single Harv@@ ard employee is now automatically en@@ rolled in a li@@ f@@ ec@@ y@@ cle fund .
For those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 funds , not 300 or more funds .
You know , often , people say , &quot; I don &apos;t know how to cut .
They &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees , &quot; T@@ ell me how these choices are different from one another .
And if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot;
Now before we started our session this afternoon , I had a chat with G@@ ary .
And G@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all-@@ exp@@ ens@@ es-@@ paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world .
Here &apos;s a description of the road .
And I &apos;d like you to read it .
And now I &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to cl@@ ap your hands if you &apos;re ready to take G@@ ary up on his offer .
Ok@@ ay . Any@@ body who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
Is that all ?
All right , let me show you some more about this .
You guys knew there was a tri@@ ck , didn &apos;t you .
Now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
I think I might have actually heard more hands .
All right .
Now in fact , you had obj@@ ectively more information the first time around than the second time around , but I would venture to gu@@ ess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
Which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice over@@ load problem , which is con@@ cre@@ tiz@@ ation .
That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivi@@ d sort of way , in a very concrete way .
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an AT@@ M card or a credit card as opposed to cash ?
Because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
So a study that I did with Sh@@ l@@ omo Ben@@ art@@ zi and Al@@ ess@@ and@@ ro Pre@@ vit@@ ero , we did a study with people at ING -- employees that are all working at ING -- and now these people were all in a session where they &apos;re doing en@@ roll@@ ment for their 4@@ 01 plan .
And during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
By doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ roll@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent .
The third technique : C@@ ateg@@ ori@@ zation .
We can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
So for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine a@@ is@@ le .
It turns out that in Weg@@ mans gro@@ cer@@ y stores up and down the nor@@ theast corrid@@ or , the magazine a@@ is@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 31 different kinds of magazines all the way up to 6@@ 64 .
But you know what ?
If I show you 600 magazines and I divide them up into 10 categories , ver@@ sus I show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600 .
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
Here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry displays .
One is called &quot; Jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; S@@ wing . &quot;
If you think the display on the left is S@@ wing and the display on the right is Jazz , cl@@ ap your hands .
Ok@@ ay , there &apos;s some .
If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is S@@ wing , cl@@ ap your hands .
Ok@@ ay , a bit more .
Now it turns out you &apos;re right .
The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is S@@ wing , but you know what ?
This is a highly us@@ eless categ@@ ori@@ zation scheme .
The categories need to say something to the choo@@ ser , not the cho@@ ic@@ e-@@ maker .
And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds .
Who are they actually supposed to be inform@@ ing ?
My fourth technique : Con@@ dition for complexity .
It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
We have to gradually increase the complexity .
I &apos;m going to show you one example of what I &apos;m talking about .
Let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
Here &apos;s a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car .
You &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
Car colors , exter@@ ior car colors -- I &apos;ve got 56 choices .
Eng@@ ines , ge@@ ar@@ shift -- four choices .
So now what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear .
So half of the customers are going to go from high choice , 56 car colors , to low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shi@@ fts .
The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shi@@ fts , to 56 car colors , high choice .
What am I going to look at ?
How engaged you are .
If you keep h@@ itting the default button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhel@@ med , that means I &apos;m losing you .
What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re h@@ itting that default button over and over and over again .
We &apos;re losing them .
They go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re hang@@ ing in there .
It &apos;s the same information . It &apos;s the same number of choices .
The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented .
If I start you off easy , I learn how to choose .
Even though choosing ge@@ ar@@ shift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose .
It also gets me exc@@ ited about this big product that I &apos;m putting together , so I &apos;m more willing to be motivated to be engaged .
So let me rec@@ ap .
I have talked about four techniques for mitig@@ ating the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alternatives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real ; categ@@ ori@@ ze -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
All of these techniques that I &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are serving .
Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choo@@ sy about choosing .
And the more we &apos;re able to be choo@@ sy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing .
Thank you very much .
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the aston@@ ishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-@@ year-old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sister , her mother and her grand@@ mother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today ?
This is not a finished story .
It is a j@@ ig@@ saw pu@@ zzle still being put together .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imag@@ ine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
He is a po@@ et , a play@@ w@@ right , a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
Imag@@ ine him as the commun@@ ists enter Sa@@ ig@@ on , confron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
Wor@@ ds , for so long his friends , now mo@@ cked him .
He re@@ treated into silence .
He died broken by history .
He is my grand@@ father .
I never knew him in real life .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
My grand@@ mother never let me forget his life .
My duty was not to allow it to have been in v@@ ain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to cr@@ ush us , but we end@@ ured .
The next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a boat in the early da@@ wn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea .
My mother , Mai , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two small girls .
For her , life had di@@ still@@ ed itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in Australia .
It was in@@ concei@@ vable to her that she would not succeed .
So after a four-@@ year sag@@ a that de@@ fies fiction , a boat sli@@ pped out to sea dis@@ gu@@ ised as a fishing vessel .
All the adults knew the risks .
The greatest fear was of pir@@ ates , rap@@ e and death .
Like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of po@@ ison .
If we were captured , first my sister and I , then she and my grand@@ mother would drink .
My first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow di@@ pping into each wave , the vast and empty horiz@@ on .
I don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates who came many times , but were blu@@ ff@@ ed by the bra@@ v@@ ado of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours .
But I do remember the lights on the oil ri@@ g off the Malay@@ sian coast and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first app@@ le I ta@@ sted , given to me by the men on the ri@@ g .
No app@@ le has ever ta@@ sted the same .
After three months in a refugee camp , we land@@ ed in Mel@@ bour@@ ne .
And the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
We settled in Foot@@ sc@@ ray , a work@@ ing-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ b whose demographic is layers of immigrants .
Unlike the settled mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ bs , whose existence I was obli@@ vious of , there was no sense of enti@@ t@@ lement in Foot@@ sc@@ ray .
The sm@@ ells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
And the s@@ ni@@ pp@@ ets of hal@@ ting English were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
My mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shi@@ fts .
Som@@ ehow she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications .
We were poor .
All the dollars were allocated and extra tu@@ ition in English and mathemati@@ cs was bud@@ get@@ ed for regardless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always sec@@ ond@@ hand .
Two p@@ airs of stock@@ ings for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
A school uniform down to the an@@ kl@@ es , because it had to last for six years .
And there were rare but se@@ aring chan@@ ts of &quot; sli@@ t-@@ eye &quot; and the occa@@ sional gra@@ ff@@ iti : &quot; Asian , go home . &quot;
Go home to where ?
Some@@ thing sti@@ ff@@ ened inside me .
There was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; I will b@@ yp@@ ass you . &quot;
My mother , my sister and I sle@@ pt in the same bed .
My mother was exhau@@ sted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grand@@ mother around the house .
My mother suffered from night@@ mar@@ es all about the boat .
And my job was to stay aw@@ ake until her night@@ mar@@ es came so I could wake her .
She opened a computer store then studied to be a beauti@@ cian and opened another business .
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , an@@ gr@@ y and inf@@ lexi@@ ble , and troub@@ led children caught between two worlds .
Gran@@ ts and spons@@ ors were sought .
Cent@@ ers were established .
I lived in parallel worlds .
In one , I was the classic Asian student , rel@@ ent@@ less in the demands that I made on myself .
In the other , I was en@@ mes@@ hed in lives that were prec@@ arious , trag@@ ically scar@@ red by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
But so many over the years were helped .
And for that work , when I was a final year law student , I was chosen as the young Australian of the year .
And I was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit .
T@@ an Le , anonymous Foot@@ sc@@ ray resident , was now T@@ an Le , refugee and social activ@@ ist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imag@@ ined .
I didn &apos;t know the protocols .
I didn &apos;t know how to use the cut@@ ler@@ y .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to retreat to the rout@@ ines and comfort of life in an uns@@ ung sub@@ ur@@ b -- a grand@@ mother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling as@@ le@@ ep , the three of us still in the same bed .
I told my mother I couldn &apos;t do it .
She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boar@@ ded the boat .
No had never been an option .
&quot; Just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the negl@@ ect of the margin@@ alized and the dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ ised .
And the more candi@@ dly I spoke , the more I was asked to speak .
I met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the fron@@ tiers of possibility .
And even though I finished my degree , I realized I could not settle into a career in law .
There had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw .
And I realized at the same time that it is ok@@ ay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a recent arrival , new on the scene -- and not just ok@@ ay , but something to be th@@ ank@@ ful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
Because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the horiz@@ ons , can so easily mean accepting the pres@@ ump@@ tions of your province .
I have step@@ ped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
Po@@ ssi@@ bili@@ ties that would not have been allowed were ou@@ trage@@ ously encouraged .
There was an energy there , an impl@@ ac@@ able optim@@ ism , a strange mixture of hum@@ ility and dar@@ ing .
So I followed my h@@ un@@ ches .
I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label &quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was an ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble challenge .
For a year we were pen@@ ni@@ less .
At the end of each day , I made a huge pot of sou@@ p which we all shared .
We worked well into each night .
Most of our ideas were cra@@ zy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after only one trip .
My h@@ un@@ ches again .
Three months later I had reloc@@ ated , and the adventure has continued .
Before I close though , let me tell you about my grand@@ mother .
She grew up at a time when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ anism was the social nor@@ m and the local Mand@@ arin was the person who mat@@ tered .
Life ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t changed for centuries .
Her father died soon after she was born .
Her mother raised her alone .
At 17 she became the second wife of a Mand@@ arin whose mother beat her .
With no support from her husband , she caused a sens@@ ation by taking him to court and prosec@@ uting her own case , and a far greater sens@@ ation when she won .
&quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in Mel@@ bour@@ ne .
I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side .
I knew she had come to say good@@ by@@ e .
My mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
A few days later , we went to a Buddh@@ ist temple in Foot@@ sc@@ ray and sat around her cas@@ ket .
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
At mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the cas@@ ket .
My mother asked us to feel her hand .
She asked the mon@@ k , &quot; Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; Because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; You have not let it go . &quot;
If there is a s@@ ine@@ w in our family , it runs through the women .
Given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us .
Def@@ eat would have come too easily .
Now I would like to have my own children , and I wonder about the boat .
Who could ever wish it on their own ?
Yet I am afraid of privilege , of ease , of enti@@ t@@ lement .
Can I give them a bow in their lives , di@@ pping bra@@ vely into each wave , the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and steady beat of the engine , the vast horiz@@ on that guarantees nothing ?
I don &apos;t know .
But if I could give it and still see them safely through , I would .
Tre@@ vor Nei@@ l@@ son : And also , T@@ an &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
H@@ i . I &apos;m Kev@@ in Al@@ loc@@ ca , I &apos;m the trends manager at YouTube , and I profession@@ ally watch YouTube videos .
It &apos;s true .
So we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go vir@@ al and then why that even matters .
We all want to be stars -- celeb@@ ri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- and when I was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday .
But there are over 48 hours of video up@@ loaded to YouTube every minute .
And of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes vir@@ al and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
So how does it happen ?
Three things : tast@@ em@@ ak@@ ers , communities of participation and un@@ expect@@ edness .
All right , let &apos;s go .
Be@@ ar V@@ as@@ qu@@ ez : O@@ h , my God . O@@ h , my God .
O@@ h , my God !
Woo@@ o !
O@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , w@@ ow@@ ww@@ w !
K@@ A : Last year , Be@@ ar V@@ as@@ qu@@ ez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yo@@ sem@@ ite National Park .
In 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
But he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a vir@@ al video , Be@@ ar .
He just wanted to share a rain@@ bow .
Because that &apos;s what you do when your name is Yo@@ sem@@ ite Mountain Be@@ ar .
And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January .
So what happened here ?
Jim@@ my K@@ imm@@ el actually .
Jim@@ my K@@ imm@@ el posted this t@@ we@@ et that would eventually prop@@ el the video to be as popular as it would become .
Because tast@@ em@@ ak@@ ers like Jim@@ my K@@ imm@@ el introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
Reb@@ ec@@ ca Black : ♫ It &apos;s Friday , Friday . Got@@ ta get down on Friday . ♫ ♫ Every@@ body &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . ♫ ♫ Friday , Friday . Get@@ tin &apos; down on Friday . ♫ K@@ A : So you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope .
Reb@@ ec@@ ca Black &apos;s &quot; Friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
It &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
This is a chart of what it looked like .
And similar to &quot; Double Rain@@ bow , &quot; it seems to have just s@@ pro@@ uted up out of no@@ where .
So what happened on this day ?
Well it was a Friday , this is true .
And if you &apos;re wonder@@ ing about those other spi@@ kes , those are also Fri@@ days .
But what about this day , this one particular Friday ?
Well To@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 picked it up , a lot of blo@@ gs starting writing about .
Michael J. N@@ elson from M@@ yst@@ ery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a jo@@ ke about the video on Twitter .
But what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of tast@@ em@@ ak@@ ers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler@@ ating the process .
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside jo@@ ke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
And now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; Friday &quot; on YouTube .
Even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ ody for every other day of the week .
Unlike the one-@@ way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
So &quot; Ny@@ an C@@ at &quot; is a lo@@ op@@ ed animation with lo@@ op@@ ed music .
It &apos;s this , just like this .
It &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
And if you think that that is wei@@ rd , you should know that there is a three-@@ hour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times .
Even c@@ ats were watching this video .
C@@ ats were watching other c@@ ats watch this video .
But what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this t@@ ech@@ ie , ge@@ ek@@ y Internet culture .
There were re@@ mix@@ es .
Some@@ one made an old tim@@ ey version .
And then it went international .
An entire re@@ mix community s@@ pro@@ uted up that brought it from being just a stup@@ id jo@@ ke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
Because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
And who could have predic@@ ted any of this ?
Who could have predic@@ ted &quot; Double Rain@@ bow &quot; or Reb@@ ec@@ ca Black or &quot; Ny@@ an C@@ at ? &quot;
What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
In a world where over two days of video get up@@ loaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy prot@@ esting bicycle fines in New York City , I admit I wasn &apos;t very interested .
Cas@@ ey Ni@@ est@@ at : So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lan@@ e , but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lan@@ e .
K@@ A : By being totally surprising and hum@@ or@@ ous , Cas@@ ey Ni@@ est@@ at got his f@@ unny idea and point seen five million times .
And so this approach holds for anything new that we do cre@@ atively .
And so it all brings us to one big question ...
Be@@ ar V@@ as@@ qu@@ ez : What does this mean ?
O@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
K@@ A : What does it mean ?
T@@ ast@@ em@@ ak@@ ers , creative participating communities , complete un@@ expect@@ edness , these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity .
I mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , Jus@@ tin B@@ ie@@ ber , got his start on YouTube .
No one has to gre@@ en-@@ light your idea .
And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
And these are not characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re barely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here to share my photography .
Or is it photography ?
Because , of course , this is a phot@@ ograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
And when you take a phot@@ ograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
But it has an unexpected tw@@ ist .
And despite that , it re@@ tains a level of realis@@ m .
Or photos like these -- both dark and color@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ taining the level of realis@@ m .
When I say realis@@ m , I mean phot@@ o-@@ realis@@ m .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a phot@@ ograph .
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the tri@@ ck .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ turing an idea than about cap@@ turing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tri@@ ck that makes it look realistic ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What creates the illu@@ sion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illu@@ sion .
But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
So I think the basi@@ cs are quite simple .
I just see it as a pu@@ zzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create altern@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imagin@@ able physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-@@ dimensional world .
But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-@@ dimensional , like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we tri@@ ck our bra@@ ins , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process with combining photographs .
It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
So the things that make a phot@@ ograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
But combined , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seam@@ less .
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
So by matching color , contrast and brigh@@ tness in the borders between the different images , adding phot@@ ographic defects like depth of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
So here &apos;s another example .
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipul@@ ated .
But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
But it does require a lot of planning .
And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the pu@@ zzle basically .
So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
The shores are from a different location .
The under@@ water part was captured in a stone pit .
And ye@@ ah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
It always starts with a sk@@ etch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
And here every piece is very well planned .
And if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projects fail .
And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
And one of the things we did at Rad@@ bou@@ d University is we appointed a chief listening officer .
Not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , &quot; What &apos;s up ?
How could we help you ? &quot;
And we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-@@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
This is my WiFi scale . It &apos;s a very simple thing .
It &apos;s got one kno@@ b , on / off .
And every morning I h@@ op on it .
And yes , I &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
And I put my challenge on 95 kg .
But the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever I h@@ op on , it sends my data through Google Health as well .
And it &apos;s collected by my general practi@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that I need car@@ di@@ olog@@ ic support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
But there &apos;s another thing .
As some of you might know , I &apos;ve got more than 4@@ ,000 fol@@ lo@@ wers on Twitter .
So every morning I h@@ op on my WiFi scale and before I &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; I think you need a light lunch today , Lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
But that &apos;s the nic@@ est thing that could happen , since this is pe@@ er pressure , pe@@ er pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for o@@ bes@@ ity , it could be used to stop smoking in patients .
But on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health .
As of next week , it will soon be available .
There will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other .
And people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
And this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be cap@@ tain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doub@@ led demand and things like that .
Make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embra@@ ce patients in the team .
And you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crow@@ d-@@ sourcing .
And one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
We &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car .
We maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cell@@ phone .
We know perfectly where all the AT@@ Ms are about the city of Maastricht .
The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
And sure , we could find fast food chains .
But where would be the nearest A@@ ED to help this patient ?
We asked around and nobody knew .
Nob@@ ody knew where the nearest life-@@ saving A@@ ED was to be obtained right now .
So what we did , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced The Netherlands .
We set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; If you see an A@@ ED , please submit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
And over 10,000 A@@ ED@@ s already in The Netherlands already have been submitted .
The next step we took was to find the applications for it .
And we built an i@@ Pad application .
We made an application for Lay@@ ar , au@@ gm@@ ented reality , to find these A@@ ED@@ s .
And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iPhone , and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cell@@ phone , to find the nearest A@@ ED which can save lives .
And as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as A@@ ED@@ 4@@ EU , which is what the product is called , but also A@@ ED@@ 4@@ US .
And we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
And &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleague universities , to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crow@@ d-@@ source all these A@@ ED@@ s all around the world .
That whenever you &apos;re on holiday and somebody collap@@ ses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us vali@@ date these A@@ ED@@ s .
These might be cour@@ ier services or cable guys for instance , just to see whether the A@@ ED that &apos;s submitted still is in place .
So please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
Thank you .
So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rock@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to h@@ ate ; we have them work in government .
The program is called Code for America , and it &apos;s a little bit like a Peace Cor@@ ps for ge@@ eks .
We select a few fel@@ lows every year and we have them work with city governments .
Instead of sending them off into the Third World , we send them into the wil@@ ds of City Hall .
And there they make great app@@ s , they work with city staff@@ ers .
But really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
So meet Al .
Al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of Boston .
Here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets snow@@ ed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow .
Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
We had a team of fel@@ lows in Boston last year through the Code for America program .
They were there in February , and it snow@@ ed a lot in February last year .
And they noticed that the city never gets to dig@@ ging out these fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts .
But one fellow in particular , a guy named Eri@@ k Mich@@ a@@ els@@ -@@ O@@ ber , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are sho@@ vel@@ ing out side@@ walks right in front of these things .
So he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
It &apos;s a cu@@ te little app where you can adopt a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
So you agree to dig it out when it s@@ no@@ ws .
If you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one Al .
And if you don &apos;t , someone can ste@@ al it from you .
So it &apos;s got cu@@ te little game dynamics on it .
This is a modest little app .
It &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 app@@ s that the fel@@ lows wrote last year .
But it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
It &apos;s spreading vir@@ ally .
There &apos;s a guy in the I.@@ T. department of the City of Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt ts@@ un@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens .
It &apos;s very important that these ts@@ un@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens work , but people ste@@ al the batteries out of them .
So he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out c@@ log@@ ged storm dra@@ ins .
And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel side@@ walks when it s@@ no@@ ws .
So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
And this has spread just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ lessly , organ@@ ically , naturally .
If you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
Pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years .
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
We were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
And that &apos;s nothing .
There is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
And there are projects like this at every level of government .
So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spre@@ ads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
And not even like a tech company , but more like the Internet itself .
And that means per@@ mis@@ sion@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative .
And that &apos;s important .
But what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an o@@ ssi@@ fied institution , but as a problem of collective action .
And that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
Now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
It &apos;s not just Code for America fel@@ lows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civi@@ c app@@ s every day in their own communities .
They haven &apos;t given up on government .
They are frustr@@ ated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not compl@@ aining about it , they &apos;re fix@@ ing it .
And these fol@@ ks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
And that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DM@@ V and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of T@@ im O &apos;@@ Rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; What we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
Now a lot of people have given up on government .
And if you &apos;re one of those people , I would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
Poli@@ tics is not changing ; government is changing .
And because government ultimately deri@@ ves its power from us -- remember &quot; We the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
Now I didn &apos;t know very much about government when I started this program .
And like a lot of people , I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
Well after two years , I &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about op@@ os@@ sums .
This is the call center for the services and information line .
It &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city .
If you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow Scott Silver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an op@@ os@@ sum stuck in your house .
So Scott gets this call .
He types &quot; O@@ pos@@ sum &quot; into this official knowledge base .
He doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . He starts with animal control .
And finally , he says , &quot; Look , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
So that worked . So boo@@ ya for Scott .
But that wasn &apos;t the end of the op@@ os@@ sums .
Boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
It has an app , a Web and mobile app , called Citizens Conn@@ ect .
Now we didn &apos;t write this app .
This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Ur@@ ban Mechan@@ ics in Boston .
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; O@@ pos@@ sum in my tr@@ ash@@ can . Can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
How do I get this removed ? &quot;
But what happens with Citizens Conn@@ ect is different .
So Scott was speaking person@@ -to-@@ person .
But on Citizens Conn@@ ect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
And in this case , a neigh@@ bor saw it .
And the next report we got said , &quot; I wal@@ ked over to this location , found the tr@@ ash@@ can behind the house .
O@@ pos@@ sum ? Check . Living ? Y@@ ep .
Tur@@ ned tr@@ ash@@ can on its side . Wal@@ ked home .
Goo@@ d@@ night sweet op@@ os@@ sum . &quot;
Pre@@ t@@ ty simple .
So this is great . This is the digital meeting the physical .
And it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d-@@ sourcing game .
But it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
And I don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
I &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
So one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here .
It connected those two people .
And it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neigh@@ bor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
When one neigh@@ bor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
We call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
And most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
That our input to the system of government is voting .
Now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
That &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-@@ inch layer on top .
And what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
And we say that word with such cont@@ emp@@ t .
But it &apos;s that cont@@ emp@@ t that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing ourselves .
People seem to think politics is sexy .
If we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bureaucracy sexy .
Because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
We have to engage with the machinery of government .
So that &apos;s O@@ cc@@ up@@ y@@ the@@ S@@ EC movement has done .
Have you seen these guys ?
It &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 32@@ 5-@@ page report that &apos;s a response to the S@@ EC &apos;s request for comment on the Financial Reform Bill .
That &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being bureauc@@ rati@@ cally active .
Now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
You have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
Do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fix@@ ing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us ?
We can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
And there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the Internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
Now the average age of our fel@@ lows is 28 , so I am , beg@@ ru@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
This is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
They &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
They can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
So when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
They &apos;re using their hands .
They &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
That could be sho@@ vel@@ ing out a hy@@ dr@@ ant , pul@@ ling a we@@ ed , turning over a gar@@ b@@ age can with an op@@ os@@ sum in it .
And certainly , we could have been sho@@ vel@@ ing out those fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts all along , and many people do .
But these app@@ s are like little digital remin@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .
We &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
And we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citizenship .
So the question I have for all of you here : When it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
Thank you .
Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected dis@@ cover@@ ies .
Now I work in the solar technology industry .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crow@@ d-@@ sourcing .
It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
Hu@@ h . H@@ ang on a moment .
It might take a moment to load .
We &apos;ll just -- we can just ski@@ p -- I &apos;ll just ski@@ p through the video instead ...
No .
This is not ...
Ok@@ ay .
Solar technology is ...
O@@ h , that &apos;s all my time ?
Ok@@ ay . Thank you very much .
Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and I thought that , since I was among friends here , I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing j@@ umps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
So I &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very bor@@ ing technology slide .
And then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
This is just a random slide that I picked out of my file .
What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of R@@ IS@@ C micro@@ process@@ ors ver@@ sus the power of local area networks .
And the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology sli@@ des that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a semi-@@ log cur@@ ve .
In other words , every step here represents an order of magn@@ it@@ ude in performance scale .
And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi-@@ log cur@@ ves .
Some@@ thing really wei@@ rd is going on here .
And that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to be talking about .
So , if you could bring up the lights .
If you could bring up the lights higher , because I &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
Now why do we draw technology cur@@ ves in semi-@@ log cur@@ ves ?
Well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal cur@@ ve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I &apos;m trying to gra@@ ph , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
They sort of go like this .
And they don &apos;t tell us much .
Now if I gra@@ ph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a semi-@@ log cur@@ ve , it would look very stup@@ id , it would look like a flat line .
But when something like this happens , things are qualit@@ atively changing .
So if transportation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ processor technology , then the day after tomorrow , I would be able to get in a taxi c@@ ab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds .
It &apos;s not moving like that .
And there &apos;s nothing preced@@ ented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ feeding growth where you go by orders of magn@@ it@@ ude every few years .
Now the question that I &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exp@@ on@@ ential cur@@ ves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
Th@@ ings just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
One of two things is going to happen .
Ei@@ ther it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical S-@@ cur@@ ve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
That &apos;s about all it can do .
Now I &apos;m an optim@@ ist , so I sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
If so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
We &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
And so what I &apos;m trying to ask , what I &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
What &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
Because the transition seems very , very conf@@ using when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
Now when I was a k@@ id growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
Now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
It &apos;s about as far as we go out .
So in other words , the future has kind of been shr@@ in@@ king one year per year for my whole lifetime .
Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
That transition is happening . We can all sense it .
And we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extra@@ pol@@ ation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
So what I would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
Now in order to do that I &apos;m going to have to talk about a b@@ unch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth .
So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
So if you go back about two and a half billion years , the Earth was this big , steri@@ le h@@ unk of rock with a lot of chemicals flo@@ ating around on it .
And if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
And I think that there &apos;s the@@ ories that are beginning to understand about how it started with R@@ NA , but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little dro@@ ps of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different recip@@ es of chemicals in them .
And some of those dro@@ ps of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of oil .
And those that were like that started to split and divide .
And those were the most pri@@ mi@@ tive forms of cells in a sense , those little dro@@ ps of oil .
But now those dro@@ ps of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recip@@ e of chemicals .
And every time it divided , they got sort of un@@ equal division of the chemicals within them .
And so every drop was a little bit different .
In fact , the dro@@ ps that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorpor@@ ating chemicals around them , grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more .
So those t@@ ended to live longer , get expressed more .
Now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these dro@@ ps learned a tri@@ ck about abstra@@ ction .
Som@@ ehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information .
They learned to record the information that was the recip@@ e of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA .
So in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ dless sort of evolu@@ tionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evol@@ ved two and a half billion years ago .
In fact the recip@@ e for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
In fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
In fact , one of the things that I did just for am@@ us@@ ement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
And I &apos;ve got here a little 100 micro@@ gram@@ s of white powder , which I try not to let the security people see at airports .
But this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symboli@@ zing it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and ampli@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card , I have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
If I had really been a eg@@ oti@@ st , I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
So what was the next step ?
Writ@@ ing down the DNA was an interesting step .
And that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communic@@ ating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
I don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacter@@ ia can actually exchange DNA .
Now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibio@@ tic resistance has evol@@ ved .
Some bacter@@ ia figur@@ ed out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ illi@@ n , and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacter@@ ia , and now we have a lot of bacter@@ ia that are resistant to pen@@ ic@@ illi@@ n , because bacter@@ ia communicate .
Now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were syn@@ erg@@ istic .
So they survi@@ ved or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favor@@ ed by evolution .
Now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole recip@@ e for the community together on one string of DNA .
And so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
And at that stage , we have multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organis@@ m .
And in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-@@ cell@@ ular community .
We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
Your skin cell is really us@@ eless without a heart cell , mus@@ cle cell , a brain cell and so on .
So these communities began to evol@@ ve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organis@@ m .
Now the next step that happened is within these communities .
These communities of cells , again , began to abstra@@ ct information .
And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
And those are the ne@@ ural structures .
So neur@@ ons are the information processing appar@@ atus that those communities of cells built up .
And in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
And that was the bra@@ ins and the ner@@ vous system of those communities .
And that gave them an evolu@@ tionary advantage .
Because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organis@@ m , instead of over this evolu@@ tionary time span .
So an organis@@ m could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it ta@@ sted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organis@@ m , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolu@@ tion@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
So that ner@@ vous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremend@@ ously sp@@ ed up the whole process of evolution .
Because evolution could now happen within an individual .
It could happen in learning time sc@@ ales .
But then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tri@@ cks of communic@@ ating .
And for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
It &apos;s really a pretty amazing inv@@ ention if you think about it .
Here I have a very complicated , mess@@ y , confused idea in my head .
I &apos;m sitting here making gr@@ unting sounds basically , and hopefully construc@@ ting a similar mess@@ y , confused idea in your head that bears some an@@ alog@@ y to it .
But we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequ@@ ences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
So this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organis@@ m .
And so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstra@@ c@@ ting out .
We &apos;re going through the same levels that multi-@@ cell@@ ular organisms have gone through -- abstra@@ c@@ ting out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information .
So for example , the inv@@ ention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
Tel@@ ep@@ hon@@ y , computers , vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ es , CD-@@ RO@@ Ms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for handling that information .
And it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evol@@ ve than what we were before .
So now , evolution can take place on a scale of micro@@ seconds .
And you saw T@@ y &apos;s little evolu@@ tionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Con@@ vol@@ ution program right before your eyes .
So now we &apos;ve spe@@ eded up the time sc@@ ales once again .
So the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece .
And the next steps , like ner@@ vous systems and bra@@ ins , took a few hundred million years .
Then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
And these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
The process is feeding on itself and becoming , I gu@@ ess , auto@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something rein@@ forces its rate of change .
The more it changes , the faster it changes .
And I think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of cur@@ ve .
We &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
Now I design computers for a living , and I know that the mechanisms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers .
So right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
I don &apos;t know what every transi@@ st@@ or in the connection machine does .
There are billions of them .
Instead , what I do and what the designers at Th@@ in@@ king Mach@@ ines do is we think at some level of abstra@@ ction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do .
And in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
One method that &apos;s particularly interesting that I &apos;ve been using a lot lat@@ ely is evolution itself .
So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micro@@ second time scale .
So for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evol@@ ve a program by starting out with random sequ@@ ences of instructions .
S@@ ay , &quot; Computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequ@@ ences of instructions .
Now would you please run all of those random sequ@@ ences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted . &quot;
So in other words , I define what I wanted .
Let &apos;s say I want to sort numbers , as a simple example I &apos;ve done it with .
So find the programs that come closest to sor@@ ting numbers .
So of course , random sequ@@ ences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
But one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
And I say , &quot; Computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequ@@ ences that did the best job .
Save those . K@@ ill off the rest .
And now let &apos;s re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best .
And let &apos;s re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ combination an@@ alog@@ ous to sex . &quot;
Take two programs and they produce children by ex@@ changing their sub@@ rout@@ ines , and the children inher@@ it the tra@@ its of the sub@@ rout@@ ines of the two programs .
So I &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
S@@ ay , &quot; Please repeat that process . &quot;
Sc@@ ore them again .
In@@ tro@@ duce some mut@@ ations perhaps .
And try that again and do that for another generation .
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milli@@ seconds .
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
At the end of that , I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers .
In fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand .
Now if I look at those programs , I can &apos;t tell you how they work .
I &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
They &apos;re ob@@ sc@@ ure , wei@@ rd programs .
But they do the job .
And in fact , I know , I &apos;m very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
In fact , their life dep@@ ended on doing the job .
I was riding in a 7@@ 47 with Mar@@ vin Min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , &quot; O@@ h look . Look at this .
It says , &apos; This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; Do@@ esn &apos;t that make you feel confident ? &quot;
In fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
So we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
And yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
So in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
We &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
So it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
The thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why I think it seems so conf@@ using .
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
We &apos;re taking off .
And what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is an@@ alog@@ ous to when single-@@ cell@@ ed organisms were turning into multi-@@ cell@@ ed organisms .
So we &apos;re the am@@ o@@ eb@@ as and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
We &apos;re right at that point of transition .
But I think that there really is something coming along after us .
I think it &apos;s very hau@@ ghty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
And I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
So lunch is coming along , and I think I will stop at that point , before I get selected out .
My story begins right here actually in Ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
I was in the desert , under the star@@ ry sk@@ ies with the Su@@ fi singer Mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar Ali .
And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian ep@@ ic &quot; The Mah@@ ab@@ har@@ ata . &quot;
So back in the day , when us Indi@@ ans wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a ch@@ ari@@ ot and we &apos;d zoom across the sky .
Now we do the same with air@@ planes .
Back then , when Ar@@ j@@ una , the great Indian war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce , when he was thir@@ sty , he &apos;d take out a bow , he &apos;d shoot it into the ground and water would come out .
Now we do the same with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines .
The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery .
And this made me really sad .
I found myself becoming a little bit of a techn@@ opho@@ be .
I was terri@@ fied by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the suns@@ et without having my camera on me , without t@@ we@@ eting it to my friends .
And it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
When I was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little silver po@@ cket watch .
And this piece of 50-@@ year-old technology became the most magical thing to me .
It became a g@@ il@@ ded g@@ ateway into a world full of pir@@ ates and ship@@ w@@ re@@ cks and images in my imagination .
So I felt like our cell@@ phones and our f@@ ancy wat@@ ches and our cameras had stopped us from dre@@ aming .
They stopped us from being inspired .
And so I j@@ ump@@ ed in , I j@@ ump@@ ed into this world of technology , to see how I could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it .
I &apos;ve been illustr@@ ating books since I was 16 .
And so when I saw the i@@ Pad , I saw it as a stor@@ y@@ telling device that could connect readers all over the world .
It can know how we &apos;re holding it .
It can know where we are .
It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
Stor@@ y@@ telling is becoming more and more multi-@@ sens@@ orial .
But what are we doing with it ?
So I &apos;m actually just going to go in and launch K@@ ho@@ ya , an interactive app for the i@@ Pad .
So it says , &quot; Place your f@@ ing@@ ers upon each light . &quot;
And so -- It says , &quot; This box belongs to ... &quot; And so I type in my name .
And actually I become a character in the book .
At various points , a little letter dro@@ ps down to me -- and the i@@ Pad knows where you live because of GPS -- which is actually addressed to me .
The child in me is really exc@@ ited by these kinds of possibilities .
Now I &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
And I don &apos;t mean wi@@ z@@ ards and dra@@ g@@ ons , I mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all har@@ bor@@ ed as children .
This idea of fire@@ fli@@ es in a j@@ ar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
And so over here you need to ti@@ lt your i@@ Pad , take the fire@@ fli@@ es out .
And they actually illumin@@ ate your way through the rest of the book .
Another idea that really fascin@@ ated me as a child was that an entire galax@@ y could be contained within a single marble .
And so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that I drag in to this magical device within the device .
And it opens up a map .
All along , all fantas@@ y books have always had maps , but these maps have been static .
This is a map that grows and g@@ lows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book .
It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
So I &apos;m just going to enter in .
Another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary .
Over here , these are the Ap@@ sar@@ as .
So we &apos;ve all heard about fai@@ ries and we &apos;ve all heard about n@@ ym@@ phs , but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counter@@ parts , the Ap@@ sar@@ as ?
These poor Ap@@ sar@@ as have been tra@@ pped inside In@@ dr@@ a &apos;s cham@@ bers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ sty book .
And so we &apos;re bringing them back in a contemporary story for children .
And a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis .
Spe@@ aking of the environmental crisis , I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms , glu@@ ed to their PCs , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
But now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
One of the inter@@ actions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this quest where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the i@@ Pad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
When I was a child , I had multiple collections of sti@@ cks and stones and p@@ eb@@ bles and sh@@ ells .
And somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
So in bringing back this childhood rit@@ ual , you need to go out and , in one chapter , take a picture of a flower and then tag it .
In another chapter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then tag that .
And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online .
A child in London puts up a picture of a fox and says , &quot; O@@ h , I saw a fox today . &quot;
A child in India says , &quot; I saw a mon@@ key today . &quot;
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
In the possibilities of linking together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
In the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your i@@ Pad out with the video on and through au@@ gm@@ ented reality , you see this layer of anim@@ ated pi@@ x@@ ies appear on a hou@@ se@@ plant that &apos;s outside your house .
At one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book .
We &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
We &apos;re har@@ ness@@ ing energy from the sun .
We &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
Thank you .
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
I spend most of my time in j@@ ails , in pris@@ ons , on death row .
I spend most of my time in very low-@@ income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hop@@ eless@@ ness .
And being here at T@@ ED and seeing the stim@@ ulation , hearing it , has been very , very energi@@ zing to me .
And one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that T@@ ED has an identity .
And you can actually say things here that have imp@@ acts around the world .
And sometimes when it comes through T@@ ED , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
And I mention that because I think identity is really important .
And we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
And I think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
If you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things .
And so I want to talk about the power of identity .
And I didn &apos;t learn about this actually practic@@ ing law and doing the work that I do .
I actually learned about this from my grand@@ mother .
I grew up in a house that was the traditional African American home that was dominated by a mat@@ ri@@ arch , and that mat@@ ri@@ arch was my grand@@ mother .
She was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
She was the end of every argument in our family .
She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
She was the daughter of people who were actually ens@@ la@@ ved .
Her parents were born in sla@@ very in Vir@@ g@@ inia in the 18@@ 40 &apos;s .
She was born in the 18@@ 80 &apos;s and the experience of sla@@ very very much shaped the way she saw the world .
And my grand@@ mother was tough , but she was also lo@@ ving .
When I would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hu@@ gs .
And she &apos;d squ@@ ee@@ ze me so tight I could barely brea@@ the and then she &apos;d let me go .
And an hour or two later , if I saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; Br@@ yan , do you still feel me hu@@ gging you ? &quot;
And if I said , &quot; No , &quot; she &apos;d ass@@ ault me again , and if I said , &quot; Yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
And she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
My mo@@ m was the yo@@ ung@@ est of her 10 kids .
And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
My c@@ ous@@ ins would be running around everywhere .
And I remember , when I was about eight or nine years old , w@@ aking up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my c@@ ous@@ ins were running around .
And my grand@@ mother was sitting across the room star@@ ing at me .
And at first I thought we were playing a game .
And I would look at her and I &apos;d s@@ mile , but she was very serious .
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; Come on , Br@@ yan . You and I are going to have a talk . &quot;
And I remember this just like it happened yesterday .
I never will forget it .
She took me out back and she said , &quot; Br@@ yan , I &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what I tell you . &quot;
I said , &quot; Ok@@ ay , M@@ ama . &quot;
She said , &quot; Now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; I said , &quot; S@@ ure . &quot;
Then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; I want you to know I &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
And she said , &quot; I think you &apos;re special . &quot;
She said , &quot; I think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
I will never forget it .
And then she said , &quot; I just need you to promise me three things , Br@@ yan . &quot;
I said , &quot; Ok@@ ay , M@@ ama . &quot;
She said , &quot; The first thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mo@@ m . &quot;
She said , &quot; That &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
Well I ad@@ ored my mo@@ m , so I said , &quot; Yes , M@@ ama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Then she said , &quot; The second thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
And I thought about it and I said , &quot; Yes , M@@ ama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Then finally she said , &quot; The third thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot;
Well I was nine years old , so I said , &quot; Yes , M@@ ama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
I grew up in the country in the rural South , and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
When I was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this six-@@ pack of beer -- I don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grab@@ bed me and my sister and we went out in the woods .
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we cra@@ zi@@ ly did .
And he had a si@@ p of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offered it to me .
I said , &quot; No , no , no . That &apos;s ok@@ ay . You all go ahead . I &apos;m not going to have any beer . &quot;
My brother said , &quot; Come on . We &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
I had some , your sister had some . Have some beer . &quot;
I said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t feel right about that . Y &apos;@@ all go ahead . Y &apos;@@ all go ahead . &quot;
And then my brother started star@@ ing at me .
He said , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? Have some beer . &quot;
Then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; O@@ h , I hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation M@@ ama had with you . &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
He said , &quot; O@@ h , M@@ ama tells all the grand@@ kids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
I was dev@@ ast@@ ated .
And I &apos;m going to admit something to you .
I &apos;m going to tell you something I probably sh@@ ouldn &apos;t .
I know this might be broadcast broadly .
But I &apos;m 52 years old , and I &apos;m going to admit to you that I &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
I don &apos;t say that because I think that &apos;s virtu@@ ous ; I say that because there is power in identity .
When we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
We can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
When I thought about my grand@@ mother , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special .
My grand@@ father was in prison during prohi@@ bition .
My male unc@@ les died of alco@@ hol@@ -@@ related diseases .
And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
Well I &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
In 1972 , there were 300@@ ,000 people in j@@ ails and pris@@ ons .
Today , there are 2.@@ 3 million .
The United States now has the highest rate of inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ation in the world .
We have seven million people on prob@@ ation and par@@ ole .
And mass inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ation , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
In poor communities , in communities of color there is this des@@ pair , there is this hop@@ eless@@ ness , that is being shaped by these out@@ comes .
One out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in j@@ ail , in prison , on prob@@ ation or par@@ ole .
In urban communities across this country -- Los Angeles , Phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a , Bal@@ tim@@ ore , Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in j@@ ail or prison or on prob@@ ation or par@@ ole .
Our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distor@@ ting around race , they &apos;re also distor@@ ted by poverty .
We have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
We@@ alth , not culp@@ ability , shapes out@@ comes .
And yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
The politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
We &apos;ve been dis@@ connected .
It &apos;s interesting to me .
We &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
My state of Al@@ ab@@ ama , like a number of states , actually permanently dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ ises you if you have a criminal conviction .
Right now in Al@@ ab@@ ama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote .
We &apos;re actually proj@@ ecting in another 10 years the level of dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ement will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the V@@ oting Rights Act .
And there is this stunning silence .
I represent children .
A lot of my clients are very young .
The United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13@@ -@@ year-old children to die in prison .
We have life impris@@ onment without par@@ ole for kids in this country .
And we &apos;re actually doing some li@@ tig@@ ation .
The only country in the world .
I represent people on death row .
It &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
In many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed ?
And that &apos;s a very sensible question .
But there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
The other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
De@@ ath penalty in America is defined by error .
For every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and released from death row .
A kind of aston@@ ishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
In aviation , we would never let people fly on air@@ planes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
But somehow we can ins@@ ulate ourselves from this problem .
It &apos;s not our problem .
It &apos;s not our burden .
It &apos;s not our struggle .
I talk a lot about these issues .
I talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
And it &apos;s interesting , when I teach my students about African American history , I tell them about sla@@ very .
I tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II .
We don &apos;t really know very much about it .
But for African Americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
In many communities , people had to worry about being l@@ yn@@ ched .
They had to worry about being bom@@ bed .
It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
And these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; Mr. St@@ ev@@ ens@@ on , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
They tell me to say , &quot; No , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
And that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by seg@@ reg@@ ation and decades of ra@@ cial sub@@ ordin@@ ation and apar@@ thei@@ d .
And yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
We don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
And because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done histor@@ ically .
We &apos;re constantly running into each other .
We &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
We have a hard time talking about race , and I believe it &apos;s because we are un@@ willing to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation .
In South Africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t overcome apar@@ thei@@ d without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
In R@@ wand@@ a , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
I was giving some lec@@ tures in Germany about the death penalty .
It was fascinating because one of the schol@@ ars stood up after the presentation and said , &quot; Well you know it &apos;s deeply troub@@ ling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
He said , &quot; We don &apos;t have the death penalty in Germany .
And of course , we can never have the death penalty in Germany . &quot;
And the room got very quiet , and this woman said , &quot; There &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings .
It would be un@@ consci@@ onable for us to , in an inten@@ tional and deliber@@ ate way , set about exec@@ uting people . &quot;
And I thought about that .
What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was exec@@ uting people , especially if they were dis@@ proportion@@ ately Jewish ?
I couldn &apos;t bear it .
It would be un@@ consci@@ onable .
And yet , in this country , in the states of the Old South , we execute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the def@@ endant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are bur@@ ied in the ground the bodies of people who were l@@ yn@@ ched .
And yet , there is this dis@@ connect .
Well I believe that our identity is at risk .
That when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implic@@ ated .
We love innovation .
We love technology . We love creativity .
We love entertainment .
But ultimately , those realities are shad@@ owed by suffering , abuse , degra@@ dation , margin@@ alization .
And for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
Because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hop@@ eful , more committed , more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
And for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never get to T@@ ED .
But thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
You know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
We do . As rational as we are , as committed to int@@ ell@@ ect as we are .
Innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fu@@ eled by some conviction in our heart .
And it &apos;s that min@@ d-@@ heart connection that I believe comp@@ els us to not just be attentive to all the bright and da@@ zz@@ ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
Vac@@ la@@ v Hav@@ el , the great Czech leader , talked about this .
He said , &quot; When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with op@@ pression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hop@@ eless places and be a witness . &quot;
Well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even T@@ ED communities have to be engaged in .
There is no dis@@ connect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to exclusion , to un@@ fair@@ ness , to in@@ justice .
Now I will war@@ n you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
It will get to you .
I had the great privilege , when I was a young lawyer , of meeting Rosa Parks .
And M@@ s. Parks used to come back to Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de@@ ar@@ est friends , these older women , John@@ nie Car@@ r who was the organiz@@ er of the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery bus boy@@ cot@@ t -- amazing African American woman -- and Vir@@ g@@ inia Dur@@ r , a white woman , whose husband , Cli@@ f@@ ford Dur@@ r , represented Dr. King .
And these women would get together and just talk .
And every now and then M@@ s. Car@@ r would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; Br@@ yan , M@@ s. Parks is coming to town . We &apos;re going to get together and talk .
Do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
And I &apos;d say , &quot; Yes , M@@ a &apos;@@ am , I do . &quot;
And she &apos;d say , &quot; Well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
And I &apos;d go over there and I would , I would just listen .
It would be so energi@@ zing and so em@@ power@@ ing .
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours M@@ s. Parks turned to me and she said , &quot; Now Br@@ yan , tell me what the Equ@@ al Justice Initiative is .
T@@ ell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
And I began giving her my ra@@ p .
I said , &quot; Well we &apos;re trying to challenge in@@ justice .
We &apos;re trying to help people who have been wron@@ g@@ ly convic@@ ted .
We &apos;re trying to confront bi@@ as and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .
We &apos;re trying to end life without par@@ ole sentences for children .
We &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
We &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
We &apos;re trying to end mass inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
I gave her my whole ra@@ p , and when I finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; M@@ mm mm@@ m mm@@ m . &quot;
She said , &quot; That &apos;s going to make you tired , tired , tired . &quot;
And that &apos;s when M@@ s. Car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; That &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve . &quot;
And I actually believe that the T@@ ED community needs to be more courage@@ ous .
We need to find ways to embra@@ ce these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
Because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
I &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that I do .
It &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
I &apos;ve come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
I believe that for every person on the planet .
I think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a li@@ ar .
I think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , they &apos;re not just a th@@ ief .
I think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a k@@ iller .
And because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .
I also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
And finally , I believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspir@@ ing and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &apos;t be judged by our design , we won &apos;t be judged by our int@@ ell@@ ect and reason .
Ultim@@ ately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the condemned , the inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ated .
Because it &apos;s in that n@@ ex@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
I sometimes get out of balance . I &apos;ll end with this story .
I sometimes push too hard .
I do get tired , as we all do .
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
And I &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been sent@@ enced to do these very harsh sentences .
And I go to the j@@ ail and I see my client who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been certified to stand trial as an adult .
I start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
How can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
And the judge has certified him as an adult , but I see this k@@ id .
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking , well go@@ sh , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power .
Y@@ e@@ ah , Br@@ yan , the judge has some magic power .
You should ask for some of that .
And because I was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , I started working on a motion .
And I had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black k@@ id .
And I started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; Motion to try my poor , 14-@@ year-old black male client like a privileged , white 7@@ 5-@@ year-old corporate executive . &quot;
And I put in my motion that there was prosec@@ ut@@ orial mis@@ conduct and police mis@@ conduct and judicial mis@@ conduct .
There was a cra@@ zy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this county , it &apos;s all mis@@ conduct .
And the next morning , I wo@@ ke up and I thought , now did I dream that cra@@ zy motion , or did I actually write it ?
And to my hor@@ ror , not only had I written it , but I had sent it to court .
A couple months went by , and I had just forgotten all about it .
And I finally decided , oh go@@ sh , I &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this cra@@ zy case .
And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhel@@ med -- overwhel@@ med .
And I got in my car and I went to this cour@@ thouse .
And I was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the cour@@ thouse .
And as I was walking up the steps of this cour@@ thouse , there was an older black man who was the jan@@ it@@ or in this cour@@ thouse .
When this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; He said , &quot; You &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; I said , &quot; Yes , si@@ r . &quot;
And this man came over to me and he hu@@ g@@ ged me .
And he wh@@ is@@ pered in my ear .
He said , &quot; I &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
And I have to tell you , it was energi@@ zing .
It connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community , to a perspective that is hop@@ eful .
Well I went into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
And as soon as I wal@@ ked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
He said , &quot; Mr. St@@ ev@@ ens@@ on , did you write this cra@@ zy motion ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , si@@ r . I did . &quot; And we started argu@@ ing .
And people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tra@@ ged .
I had written these cra@@ zy things .
And police officers were coming in and assi@@ stant prosec@@ uters and c@@ ler@@ k workers .
And before I knew it , the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with people an@@ gr@@ y that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about inequality .
And out of the corner of my eye , I could see this jan@@ it@@ or pac@@ ing back and forth .
And he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this h@@ oll@@ er .
He kept pac@@ ing back and forth .
And finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the cour@@ tro@@ om and sat down behind me , almost at coun@@ sel table .
About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
And during the break there was a dep@@ uty sh@@ eri@@ ff who was off@@ ended that the jan@@ it@@ or had come into court .
And this dep@@ uty j@@ ump@@ ed up and he ran over to this older black man .
He said , &quot; Jim@@ my , what are you doing in this cour@@ tro@@ om ? &quot;
And this older black man stood up and he looked at that dep@@ uty and he looked at me and he said , &quot; I came into this cour@@ tro@@ om to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
I &apos;ve come to T@@ ED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral ar@@ c of the universe is long , but it b@@ ends toward justice .
That we cannot be full evol@@ ved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
That all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
That our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , comp@@ as@@ sion and justice .
And more than anything , for those of you who share that , I &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
Thank you very much .
So you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
Other than writing a check , what could we do ?
BS : Well there are opportunities all around us .
If you live in the state of California , for example , there &apos;s a referendum coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to re@@ direct some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment .
For example , here in California we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
And yet , 46 percent of all hom@@ ici@@ de cases don &apos;t result in arrest .
56 percent of all rap@@ e cases don &apos;t result .
So there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
And this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
And I think that opportunity exists all around us .
There &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades .
And part of the nar@@ r@@ ative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ation rates .
What would you say to someone who believed that ?
BS : Well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
The great increase in mass inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories .
It was this mis@@ guided war on drugs .
That &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment .
And so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for ste@@ aling a bicycle , for low-@@ level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they vic@@ tim@@ ized .
I believe we need to do more to help people who are vic@@ tim@@ ized by crime , not do less .
And I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
And I think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
Br@@ yan , you &apos;ve struck a massive ch@@ ord here .
You &apos;re an inspir@@ ing person .
Thank you so much for coming to T@@ ED . Thank you .
I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
And I think it starts with one physi@@ cian , and that &apos;s me .
And maybe I &apos;ve been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false pres@@ tige to be able to do that .
Before I actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of bas@@ eb@@ all .
H@@ ey , why not ?
We &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the World Series .
We all love bas@@ eb@@ all , don &apos;t we ?
Bas@@ eb@@ all is filled with some amazing statistics .
And there &apos;s hundreds of them .
&quot; Mon@@ ey@@ ball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great bas@@ eb@@ all team .
I &apos;m going to focus on one stat that I hope a lot of you have heard of .
It &apos;s called bat@@ ting average .
So we talk about a 300 , a bat@@ ter who b@@ ats 300 .
That means that ball@@ player bat@@ ted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at b@@ ats .
That means hit the ball into the out@@ field , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and wh@@ o@@ ever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the run@@ ner was safe .
Three times out of 10 .
Do you know what they call a 300 hit@@ ter in Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ?
Good , really good , maybe an all-@@ star .
Do you know what they call a 400 bas@@ eb@@ all hit@@ ter ?
That &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 .
Leg@@ end@@ ary -- as in T@@ ed Willi@@ ams legendary -- the last Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
Now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where I &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I &apos;m going to talk to you about .
Sup@@ pose you have app@@ endi@@ ci@@ tis and you &apos;re referred to a sur@@ ge@@ on who &apos;s bat@@ ting 400 on app@@ en@@ dec@@ tom@@ ies .
Som@@ ehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
Now sup@@ pose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has block@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ ies and your family doctor refers that loved one to a car@@ di@@ ologist who &apos;s bat@@ ting 200 on an@@ gi@@ op@@ las@@ ties .
But , but , you know what ?
She &apos;s doing a lot better this year . She &apos;s on the com@@ eb@@ ack trail .
And she &apos;s h@@ itting a 25@@ 7 .
Som@@ ehow this isn &apos;t working .
But I &apos;m going to ask you a question .
What do you think a bat@@ ting average for a car@@ di@@ ac sur@@ ge@@ on or a nur@@ se practi@@ tion@@ er or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c sur@@ ge@@ on , an O@@ B@@ G@@ Y@@ N , a par@@ ame@@ dic is supposed to be ?
1,000 , very good .
Now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good sur@@ ge@@ on or physi@@ cian or par@@ ame@@ dic is supposed to bat .
What we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ ition , be perfect .
N@@ ever ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
And that was the message that I absor@@ bed when I was in med school .
I was an ob@@ ses@@ sive comp@@ ul@@ sive student .
In high school , a class@@ m@@ ate once said that Bri@@ an Gold@@ man would study for a blood test .
And so I did .
And I studied in my little gar@@ ret at the nur@@ ses &apos; residence at Tor@@ onto General Hospital , not far from here .
And I mem@@ ori@@ zed everything .
I mem@@ ori@@ zed in my an@@ atom@@ y class the origins and exer@@ tions of every mus@@ cle , every branch of every ar@@ tery that came off the a@@ or@@ ta , differ@@ ential diagno@@ ses ob@@ sc@@ ure and common .
I even knew the differ@@ ential diagnosis in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ b@@ ular aci@@ do@@ sis .
And all the while , I was am@@ ass@@ ing more and more knowledge .
And I did well , I gradu@@ ated with hon@@ ors , c@@ um lau@@ de .
And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I mem@@ ori@@ zed everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would imm@@ uni@@ ze me against making mistakes .
And it worked for a while , until I met Mr@@ s. Drucker .
I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Tor@@ onto when Mr@@ s. Drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working .
At the time I was assigned to the car@@ di@@ ology service on a car@@ di@@ ology ro@@ tation .
And it was my job , when the emergency staff called for a car@@ di@@ ology consult , to see that patient in emer@@ g .
and to report back to my attending .
And I saw Mr@@ s. Drucker , and she was breath@@ less .
And when I listened to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ zy sound .
And when I listened to her ch@@ est with a ste@@ tho@@ scope , I could hear cra@@ ck@@ ly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure .
This is a condition in which the heart fails , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood backs up into the lung , the l@@ ungs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have shor@@ tness of bre@@ ath .
And that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
I made it and I set to work treating her .
I gave her aspir@@ in . I gave her medic@@ ations to rel@@ ieve the stra@@ in on her heart .
I gave her medic@@ ations that we call di@@ ur@@ e@@ tics , water p@@ ills , to get her to pe@@ e out the access flu@@ id .
And over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
And I felt really good .
And that &apos;s when I made my first mistake ; I sent her home .
Ac@@ tually , I made two more mistakes .
I sent her home without speaking to my attending .
I didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do , which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
And he knew her , he would have been able to furnis@@ h additional information about her .
Maybe I did it for a good reason .
Maybe I didn &apos;t want to be a high-@@ maintenance resident .
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
The second mistake that I made was worse .
In sending her home , I dis@@ regarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; Gold@@ man , not a good idea . Don &apos;t do this . &quot;
In fact , so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nur@@ se who was looking after Mr@@ s. Drucker , &quot; Do you think it &apos;s ok@@ ay if she goes home ? &quot;
And the nur@@ se thought about it and said very mat@@ ter-@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly , &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , I think she &apos;ll do ok@@ ay . &quot;
I can remember that like it was yesterday .
So I signed the discharge papers , and an am@@ bul@@ ance came , par@@ ame@@ dic@@ s came to take her home .
And I went back to my work on the wards .
All the rest of that day , that afternoon , I had this kind of gn@@ a@@ wing feeling inside my stom@@ ach .
But I carried on with my work .
And at the end of the day , I packed up to leave the hospital and wal@@ ked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don &apos;t usually do .
I wal@@ ked through the emergency department on my way home .
And it was there that another nur@@ se , not the nur@@ se who was looking after Mr@@ s. Drucker before , but another nur@@ se , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physi@@ cians I know d@@ read .
Others in medicine d@@ read them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fle@@ et@@ ingly .
The three words are : Do you remember ?
&quot; Do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
the other nur@@ se asked mat@@ ter-@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly .
&quot; Well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .
Well she was back all right .
She was back and near death .
About an hour after she had arrived home , after I &apos;d sent her home , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the par@@ ame@@ dic@@ s brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock .
And she was barely brea@@ thing and she was blue .
And the emerg@@ . staff pul@@ led out all the stops .
They gave her medic@@ ations to raise her blood pressure .
They put her on a venti@@ lat@@ or .
And I was sho@@ cked and sha@@ ken to the core .
And I went through this roll@@ er co@@ aster , because after they stabili@@ zed her , she went to the intensive care unit , and I hoped against hope that she would recover .
And over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
She had irre@@ ver@@ sible brain damage .
And the family gathered .
And over the course of the next eight or nine days , they resign@@ ed themselves to what was happening .
And at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- Mr@@ s. Drucker , a wife , a mother and a grand@@ mother .
They say you never forget the names of those who die .
And that was my first time to be acqu@@ ain@@ ted with that .
Over the next few weeks , I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the un@@ healthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
You know that healthy kind , when you betra@@ y a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend confron@@ ts you and you have terrible discussions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say , I &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
And you make amend@@ s and you never make that mistake again .
That &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
The un@@ healthy shame I &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
It &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
And it was what I was feeling .
And it wasn &apos;t because of my attending ; he was a d@@ oll .
He talked to the family , and I &apos;m quite sure that he smooth@@ ed things over and made sure that I didn &apos;t get su@@ ed .
And I kept asking myself these questions .
Why didn &apos;t I ask my attending ? Why did I send her home ?
And then at my worst moments : Why did I make such a stup@@ id mistake ?
Why did I go into medicine ?
S@@ low@@ ly but surely , it li@@ fted .
I began to feel a bit better .
And on a clou@@ dy day , there was a cra@@ ck in the clou@@ ds and the sun started to come out and I wonder@@ ed , maybe I could feel better again .
And I made myself a bar@@ gain that if only I re@@ double my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
And they did .
And I went back to work .
And then it happened again .
Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Tor@@ onto , and I saw a 25 year-old man with a s@@ ore thro@@ at .
It was busy , I was in a bit of a hur@@ ry .
He kept pointing here .
I looked at his thro@@ at , it was a little bit p@@ ink .
And I gave him a pres@@ cription for pen@@ ic@@ illi@@ n and sent him on his way .
And even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of pointing to his thro@@ at .
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quiet@@ ly in her office .
And she said the three words : Do you remember ?
&quot; Do you remember that patient you saw with the s@@ ore thro@@ at ? &quot;
Well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a stre@@ p thro@@ at .
He had a potentially life-@@ threatening condition called ep@@ ig@@ lot@@ ti@@ tis .
You can Google it , but it &apos;s an infection , not of the thro@@ at , but of the upper air@@ way , and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close .
And fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
He was placed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous antibio@@ tics and he recover@@ ed after a few days .
And I went through the same period of shame and rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
Twi@@ ce in one emergency shift , I missed app@@ endi@@ ci@@ tis .
Now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
Now in both cases , I didn &apos;t send them home and I don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
One I thought had a kid@@ ney stone .
I ordered a kid@@ ney X-@@ ray . When it turned out to be normal , my colleague who was doing a re@@ assessment of the patient noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower quad@@ rant and called the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
The other one had a lot of diar@@ r@@ he@@ a .
I ordered some flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ dr@@ ate him and asked my colleague to re@@ assess him .
And he did and when he noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower quad@@ rant , called the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
In both cases , they had their operations and they did ok@@ ay .
But each time , they were gn@@ a@@ wing at me , eating at me .
And I &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total B.@@ S.
Some of my d@@ oo@@ zi@@ es have been in the last five years .
Al@@ one , ash@@ amed and un@@ supported .
Here &apos;s the problem : If I can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if I can &apos;t find the still@@ -@@ small voice that tells me what really happened , how can I share it with my colleagues ?
How can I teach them about what I did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
If I were to walk into a room -- like right now , I have no idea what you think of me .
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
O@@ h ye@@ ah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
If I were to walk into a room filled with my col@@ le@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I &apos;ve just told you right now , I probably w@@ ouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfortable , somebody would cra@@ ck a jo@@ ke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
And in fact , if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , I &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
That &apos;s the system that we have .
It &apos;s a complete den@@ ial of mistakes .
It &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep de@@ priv@@ ation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ comes .
And it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person .
And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
But there are two problems with that .
In my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journ@@ alism , I &apos;ve made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical errors to learn everything I can , from one of the first articles I wrote for the Tor@@ onto Star to my show &quot; White Co@@ at , Black Art . &quot;
And what I &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
We work in a system where errors happen every day , where one in 10 medic@@ ations are either the wrong medic@@ ation given in hospital or at the wrong do@@ sage , where hospit@@ al-@@ acquired inf@@ ections are getting more and more numerous , causing ha@@ vo@@ c and death .
In this country , as many as 24@@ ,000 Canadi@@ ans die of prev@@ ent@@ able medical errors .
In the United States , the Institute of Medic@@ ine p@@ eg@@ ged it at 100@@ ,000 .
In both cases , these are gross under@@ estimates , because we really aren &apos;t fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we should .
And here &apos;s the thing .
In a hospital system where medical knowledge is dou@@ bling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
S@@ le@@ ep de@@ priv@@ ation is absolutely per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve .
We can &apos;t get rid of it .
We have our co@@ gni@@ tive bi@@ ases , so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with ch@@ est pain .
Now take the same patient with ch@@ est pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ rul@@ ous and put a little bit of alcohol on their bre@@ ath , and suddenly my history is lac@@ ed with cont@@ emp@@ t .
I don &apos;t take the same history .
I &apos;m not a ro@@ bot ; I don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
And my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
Given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
So if you take the system , as I was taught , and we@@ ed out all the err@@ or-@@ pr@@ one health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
On my show , on &quot; White Co@@ at , Black Art , &quot; I made it a hab@@ it of saying , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; I would say to everybody from par@@ ame@@ dic@@ s to the chief of car@@ di@@ ac surgery , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; bl@@ ah , bl@@ ah , bl@@ ah , bl@@ ah , bl@@ ah , &quot; What about yours ? &quot; and I would point the micro@@ phone towards them .
And their pupils would di@@ late , they would reco@@ il , then they would look down and s@@ wal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stories .
They want to tell their stories . They want to share their stories .
They want to be able to say , &quot; Look , don &apos;t make the same mistake I did . &quot;
What they need is an environment to be able to do that .
What they need is a re@@ defined medical culture .
And it starts with one physi@@ cian at a time .
The re@@ defined physi@@ cian is human , knows she &apos;s human , accepts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
She shares her experience with others .
She &apos;s suppor@@ tive when other people talk about their mistakes .
And she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a g@@ ot@@ cha way , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way so that everybody can benefit .
And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowled@@ ges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
So the system is evol@@ ving to create back@@ ups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fo@@ sters in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way places where everybody who is ob@@ serving in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewar@@ ded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewar@@ ded for coming clean .
My name is Bri@@ an Gold@@ man .
I am a re@@ defined physi@@ cian .
I &apos;m human . I make mistakes .
I &apos;m sorry about that , but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people .
I still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but I can live with that .
And let me close with three words of my own : I do remember .
An@@ no@@ unc@@ er : Th@@ re@@ ats , in the wake of B@@ in Laden &apos;s death , have spi@@ ked .
An@@ no@@ unc@@ er Two : Fam@@ ine in Somalia . An@@ no@@ unc@@ er Three : Police p@@ ep@@ per spra@@ y .
An@@ no@@ unc@@ er Four : V@@ icious car@@ tels . An@@ no@@ unc@@ er Five : C@@ aus@@ tic cru@@ ise lines .
An@@ no@@ unc@@ er Six : Soci@@ etal dec@@ ay . An@@ no@@ unc@@ er Seven : 65 dead .
An@@ no@@ unc@@ er Ei@@ ght : T@@ sun@@ ami warning . An@@ no@@ unc@@ er N@@ ine : Cyber@@ -@@ attacks .
Multi@@ ple An@@ no@@ unc@@ ers : Dru@@ g war . M@@ ass destruction . Tor@@ n@@ ado .
Rec@@ ession . Def@@ ault . Do@@ om@@ s@@ day . Egypt . Syria .
Cris@@ is . De@@ ath . Dis@@ aster .
O@@ h , my God .
Peter Diam@@ andi@@ s : So those are just a few of the cli@@ ps I collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
The point is that the news media prefer@@ enti@@ ally feeds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
And there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
Every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our bra@@ ins .
And because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sli@@ ver of the tempor@@ al lo@@ be called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
Now the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early warning det@@ ector , our danger det@@ ector .
It sorts and s@@ cour@@ s through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us .
So given a do@@ zen news stories , we will prefer@@ enti@@ ally look at the negative news .
And that old newspaper saying , &quot; If it ble@@ eds it leads , &quot; is very true .
So given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re p@@ essimis@@ tic .
It &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
But perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
Perhaps instead , it &apos;s the distor@@ tions brought to us of what &apos;s really going on .
Perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , acceler@@ ating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abund@@ ance .
Now I &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems -- climate crisis , species ext@@ inc@@ tion , water and energy shortage -- we surely do .
And as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance , but ultimately we kno@@ ck them down .
So let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
Over the last hundred years , the average human li@@ fes@@ p@@ an has more than doub@@ led , average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tri@@ pled .
Chil@@ d@@ hood mort@@ ality has come down a factor of 10 .
Add to that the cost of food , electricity , transportation , communication have dropped 10 to 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ fold .
Steve Pin@@ ker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most peaceful time ever in human history .
And Charles Kenn@@ y that global liter@@ acy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years .
We truly are living in an extraordinary time .
And many people forget this .
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
In fact , we re@@ define what poverty means .
Th@@ ink of this , in America today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toil@@ ets , refriger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , air conditioning and cars .
The weal@@ thi@@ est rob@@ ber bar@@ ons of the last century , the em@@ per@@ ors on this planet , could have never dre@@ amed of such lux@@ uries .
Under@@ p@@ inning much of this is technology , and of late , exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally growing technologies .
My good friend Ray Kur@@ zwei@@ l showed that any tool that becomes an information technology j@@ umps on this cur@@ ve , on Mo@@ ore &apos;s Law , and experiences price performance dou@@ bling every 12 to 24 months .
That &apos;s why the cell@@ phone in your po@@ cket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer of the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
Now look at this cur@@ ve .
This is Mo@@ ore &apos;s Law over the last hundred years .
I want you to notice two things from this cur@@ ve .
Num@@ ber one , how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , recession , depression and boom time .
This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
It doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
And also , even though it &apos;s pl@@ ot@@ ted on a log cur@@ ve on the left , it &apos;s cur@@ ving up@@ wards .
The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
And on this cur@@ ve , riding on Mo@@ ore &apos;s Law , are a set of extra@@ ordin@@ arily powerful technologies available to all of us .
Cl@@ oud comp@@ uting , what my friends at Auto@@ desk call infin@@ ite comp@@ uting ; sensors and networks ; ro@@ bo@@ tics ; 3D printing , which is the ability to democrati@@ ze and distribute personalized production around the planet ; synthetic bi@@ ology ; fuels , vacc@@ ines and foods ; digital medicine ; nan@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als ; and A.@@ I.
I mean , how many of you saw the winning of Je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy by IBM &apos;s Watson ?
I mean , that was ep@@ ic .
In fact , I s@@ cour@@ ed the head@@ lines looking for the best head@@ line in a newspaper I could .
And I love this : &quot; Watson Van@@ qu@@ ishes Human O@@ pp@@ on@@ ents . &quot;
Je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s not an easy game .
It &apos;s about the nu@@ ance of human language .
And imagine if you would A.@@ I. &apos; s like this on the cl@@ oud available to every person with a cell@@ phone .
Four years ago here at T@@ ED , Ray Kur@@ zwei@@ l and I started a new university called Sing@@ ul@@ arity University .
And we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
And every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
Th@@ ink about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
30 years ago that would have sound@@ ed lu@@ dic@@ ro@@ us .
Today we can point at doz@@ ens of companies that have done just that .
When I think about creating abund@@ ance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
It is about taking that which was scar@@ ce and making it abund@@ ant .
You see , scar@@ city is contextual , and technology is a resour@@ ce-@@ liber@@ ating force .
Let me give you an example .
So this is a story of Napol@@ eon III in the mid-@@ 18@@ 00@@ s .
He &apos;s the du@@ de on the left .
He invited over to dinner the king of Si@@ am .
All of Napol@@ eon &apos;s troops were fed with silver uten@@ si@@ ls , Napol@@ eon himself with gold uten@@ si@@ ls .
But the King of Si@@ am , he was fed with al@@ umin@@ um uten@@ si@@ ls .
You see , al@@ umin@@ um was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and plat@@ in@@ um .
It &apos;s the reason that the tip of the Washington Monum@@ ent is made of al@@ umin@@ um .
You see , even though al@@ umin@@ um is 8.@@ 3 percent of the Earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
It &apos;s all bound by oxy@@ gen and si@@ lic@@ ates .
But then the technology of elec@@ trol@@ y@@ sis came along and literally made al@@ umin@@ um so cheap that we use it with thro@@ w-@@ away ment@@ ality .
So let &apos;s project this an@@ alog@@ y going forward .
We think about energy scar@@ city .
Ladies and gentlemen , we are on a planet that is bath@@ ed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of energy h@@ its the Earth &apos;s surface every 88 minutes .
It &apos;s not about being scar@@ ce , it &apos;s about accessibility .
And there &apos;s good news here .
For the first time , this year the cost of sol@@ ar-@@ generated electricity is 50 percent that of dies@@ el-@@ generated electricity in India -- 8.@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es ver@@ sus 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
Last month , M@@ IT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sunny parts of the United States , solar electricity will be six c@@ ents a ki@@ low@@ att hour compared to 15 c@@ ents as a national average .
And if we have abund@@ ant energy , we also have abund@@ ant water .
Now we talk about water wars .
Do you remember when Carl Sag@@ an turned the Voyager spac@@ ec@@ raft back towards the Earth , in 1990 after it just passed Satur@@ n ?
He took a famous photo . What was it called ?
&quot; A P@@ ale Blue Do@@ t . &quot;
Because we live on a water planet .
We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
Yes , 9@@ 7.@@ 5 percent is sal@@ tw@@ ater , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
And there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
There &apos;s nan@@ otechn@@ ology coming on , nan@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als .
And the conversation I had with D@@ ean K@@ amen this morning , one of the great DI@@ Y innov@@ ators , I &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called S@@ ling@@ shot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dor@@ m room refriger@@ ator .
It &apos;s able to generate a thousand li@@ ters of clean drinking water a day out of any source -- sal@@ tw@@ ater , poll@@ uted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- at less than two c@@ ents a li@@ ter .
The chairman of Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world .
And if that p@@ ans out , which I have every confidence it will , Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a will deplo@@ y this globally to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
This is the kind of innovation , em@@ powered by this technology , that exists today .
And we &apos;ve seen this in cell@@ phones .
My goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent pen@@ etr@@ ation of cell@@ phones in the developing world by the end of 2013 .
Th@@ ink about it , that a Mas@@ ai war@@ ri@@ or on a cell@@ phone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile com@@ m than President Re@@ ag@@ an did 25 years ago .
And if they &apos;re on a sm@@ art@@ phone on Google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago .
They &apos;re living in a world of information and communication abund@@ ance that no one could have ever predic@@ ted .
Better than that , the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- GPS , HD video and still images , libraries of books and music , medical diagno@@ stic technology -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ alizing and demon@@ e@@ tiz@@ ing into your cell@@ phone .
Prob@@ ably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pi@@ ke in health .
Last month , I had the pleasure of announc@@ ing with Qual@@ com@@ m Foundation something called the $ 10 million Qual@@ com@@ m Tri@@ c@@ order X Prize .
We &apos;re challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got A.@@ I. , you can c@@ ough on it , you can do a finger blood pri@@ ck .
And to win , it needs to be able to diagno@@ se you better than a team of bo@@ ard-@@ certified doctors .
So literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers .
When this device sequ@@ ences an R@@ NA or DNA virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the CD@@ C and prevents the pan@@ demic from happening in the first place .
But here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abund@@ ance .
I call it the rising billion .
So the white lines here are population .
We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth .
And by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy .
In 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
By 2020 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion Internet users .
Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation .
What will these people want ?
What will they consu@@ me ? What will they desire ?
And rather than having economic sh@@ ut@@ down , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic injection ever .
These people represent tens of trilli@@ ons of dollars inj@@ ected into the global economy .
And they will get health@@ ier by using the Tri@@ c@@ order , and they &apos;ll become better educated by using the Kh@@ an Academy , and by literally being able to use 3D printing and infin@@ ite comp@@ uting &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
So what could three billion rising , healthy , educated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
What about giving the op@@ pressed , wherever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
What will these three billion people bring ?
What about contributions we can &apos;t even predic@@ t ?
The one thing I &apos;ve learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past .
Let me share and close with a story that really got me exc@@ ited .
There is a program that some of you might have heard of .
It &apos;s a game called Fol@@ dit .
It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle .
And this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of am@@ ino aci@@ ds and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
And how it fol@@ ds dict@@ ates its structure and its functionality .
And it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
And up until now , it &apos;s been a super@@ computer problem .
And this game has been played by university prof@@ essors and so forth .
And it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
And it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recognition machinery is better at fol@@ ding prot@@ eins than the best computers .
And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world , it wasn &apos;t an M@@ IT professor , it wasn &apos;t a Cal@@ Tech student , it was a person from England , from Manchester , a woman who , during the day , was an executive assi@@ stant at a rehab clin@@ ic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein folder .
Ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more em@@ powered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
We have the tools with this exp@@ on@@ ential technology .
We have the passion of the DI@@ Y innov@@ ator .
We have the capital of the t@@ ech@@ no-@@ phi@@ lan@@ throp@@ ist .
And we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
We are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
And this is about shi@@ fting bas@@ eline .
And because the idea can be explained in one minute , I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
And the first story is about Charles Dar@@ win , one of my her@@ oes .
And he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
And you &apos;d think he was ch@@ asing fin@@ ches , but he wasn &apos;t .
He was actually collecting fish .
And he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
This was the sail@@ fin group@@ er .
A big fisher@@ y was run on it until the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
Now the fish is on the I@@ UC@@ N Red List .
Now this story , we have heard it lots of times on Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
But the point is , we still come to Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os .
We still think it is pri@@ st@@ ine .
The broch@@ ures still say it is un@@ touched .
So what happens here ?
The second story , also to illustr@@ ate another concept , is called shi@@ fting wa@@ ist@@ line .
Because I was there in &apos; 71 , studying a lag@@ oon in West Africa .
I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa .
And I thought I could blend in .
And I got a big sun@@ burn , and I was convinced that I was really not from there .
This was my first sun@@ burn .
And the lag@@ oon was surrounded by pal@@ m trees , as you can see , and a few man@@ gro@@ ve .
And it had til@@ ap@@ ia about 20 cen@@ tim@@ eters , a species of til@@ ap@@ ia called black@@ ch@@ in til@@ ap@@ ia .
And the fisheries for this til@@ ap@@ ia sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Gh@@ ana .
When I went there 27 years later , the fish had shr@@ unk to half of their size .
They were mat@@ uring at five cen@@ tim@@ eters .
They had been pushed genetically .
There were still fish@@ es .
They were still kind of happy .
And the fish also were happy to be there .
So nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
My third little story is that I was an accomp@@ li@@ ce in the introduction of tra@@ w@@ ling in Sou@@ theast Asia .
In the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- Europe did lots of development projects .
F@@ ish development meant imposing on countries that had already 100@@ ,000 fish@@ ers to impose on them industrial fishing .
And this boat , quite ug@@ ly , is called the Mu@@ ti@@ ara 4 .
And I went sailing on it , and we did surve@@ ys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the Java Sea .
And what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
What we caught , I know now , is the bottom of the sea .
And 90 percent of our catch were sp@@ on@@ ges , other animals that are fixed on the bottom .
And actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the de@@ br@@ is , the pil@@ es of de@@ br@@ is , were cor@@ al re@@ ef fish .
Es@@ senti@@ ally the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down .
And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
Within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
The bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft cor@@ al into a mu@@ d@@ dy m@@ ess .
This is a dead tur@@ tle .
They were not e@@ aten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
And one time we caught a live one .
It was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet .
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
This mountain of de@@ br@@ is is actually collected by fish@@ ers every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fish@@ ed .
But it &apos;s not documented .
We transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
We adjust our bas@@ eline to the new level , and we don &apos;t recall what was there .
If you gener@@ alize this , something like this happens .
You have on the y axis some good thing : biodiversity , numbers of orca , the gre@@ enness of your country , the water supply .
And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extra@@ pol@@ ate forward .
And the difference then , they perc@@ eive as a loss .
But they don &apos;t perc@@ eive what happened before as a loss .
You can have a succ@@ ession of changes .
At the end you want to sustain mis@@ er@@ able le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
And that , to a large extent , is what we want to do now .
We want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in pre@@ dat@@ ory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations .
Because , obviously , an animal that is very abund@@ ant , before it gets ext@@ inc@@ t , it becomes rare .
So you don &apos;t lose abund@@ ant animals .
You always lose rare animals .
And therefore they &apos;re not perceived as a big loss .
Over time , we concentrate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
They become rar@@ er because we fish them .
Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the bas@@ eline .
And the question is , why do people accept this ?
Well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
And in fact , lots of people , scientists , will contest that it was really different .
And they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented .
For example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that some present , as Captain so-@@ and-@@ so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utili@@ zed by fisher@@ y scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
So you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
And hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
Because with marine protected areas , we actually recre@@ ate the past .
We recre@@ ate the past that people cannot conc@@ eive because the bas@@ eline has shi@@ fted and is extremely low .
That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to res@@ et their bas@@ eline .
How about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the Mid@@ west for example ?
There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
This is a simulation of Ch@@ es@@ ap@@ e@@ ake Bay .
There were gra@@ y wh@@ ales in Ch@@ es@@ ap@@ e@@ ake Bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
And you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and tones are like &quot; Av@@ atar . &quot;
And if you think about &quot; Av@@ atar , &quot; if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the Po@@ c@@ ah@@ ont@@ as story -- why so touched by the ima@@ gery ?
Because it ev@@ ok@@ es something that in a sense has been lost .
And so my recommendation , it &apos;s the only one I will provide , is for Cam@@ eron to do &quot; Av@@ atar II &quot; under@@ water .
Thank you very much .
In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to register it with the government .
You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writer .
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
We would never do that in our own countries .
But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow d@@ ots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
This is happening to us today .
And nobody seems to be making a f@@ uss about it .
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attack@@ ers .
We have three main groups .
We have online criminals .
Like here , we have Mr. Dim@@ it@@ ry Gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of K@@ iev in Ukraine .
And the mo@@ tives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
We actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ aires online , mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aires , who made money with their attacks .
Here &apos;s V@@ ladimir T@@ sa@@ st@@ sin form Tar@@ tu in Estonia .
This is Al@@ fred Gonz@@ al@@ ez .
This is Stephen Wat@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ orn Sun@@ din .
This is Mat@@ the@@ w Ander@@ son , Tari@@ q Al-@@ Da@@ our and so on and so on .
These guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with key@@ log@@ gers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
The U.S. Sec@@ ret Service , two months ago , fro@@ ze the Swiss bank account of Mr. S@@ am J@@ ain right here , and that bank account had 14.@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
Mr. J@@ ain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
The second major group of attack@@ ers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
They &apos;re motivated by something else -- motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the lau@@ ghs .
Gro@@ ups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
So those are the three main attack@@ ers : criminals who do it for the money , h@@ ack@@ tivi@@ sts like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
And then we look at cases like what happened in Di@@ gi@@ Not@@ ar .
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
Di@@ gi@@ Not@@ ar is a Certi@@ fic@@ ate Authority from The Netherlands -- or actually , it was .
It was running into bank@@ rupt@@ cy last fall because they were h@@ ack@@ ed into .
Som@@ ebody broke in and they h@@ ack@@ ed it thoroughly .
And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ sible that people died because of the Di@@ gi@@ Not@@ ar h@@ ack .
And his answer was yes .
So how do people die as the result of a h@@ ack like this ?
Well Di@@ gi@@ Not@@ ar is a C.@@ A.
They sell certificates .
What do you do with certificates ?
Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has htt@@ ps , SSL encrypted services , services like G@@ mail .
Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ mail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalit@@ arian states like Iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like G@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ worthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their discussions .
Exc@@ ept they can if they h@@ ack into a foreign C.@@ A.
and issue ro@@ gue certificates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of Di@@ gi@@ Not@@ ar .
What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
Well in Egypt , the ri@@ o@@ ters lo@@ oted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were lo@@ oting the building they found lots of papers .
Among those papers , was this bin@@ der entitled &quot; FIN@@ F@@ IS@@ H@@ ER . &quot;
And within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
They had sold this tool for 28@@ 0@@ ,000 Euros to the Egyptian government .
The company headquarters are right here .
So Western governments are providing totalit@@ arian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Tro@@ jan was found , which was a tro@@ jan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be t@@ apped .
But today , it goes beyond that .
They will t@@ ap your Internet connection .
They will even use tools like State Tro@@ jan to inf@@ ect your computer with a tro@@ jan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your pass@@ words .
Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; Ok@@ ay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
Why should I worry ?
Because I have nothing to hide . &quot;
And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
Privacy is imp@@ lied .
Privacy is not up for discussion .
This is not a question between privacy against security .
It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
And do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
This may sound strange , but I &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block .
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 18@@ 68 with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together .
Very quickly concrete blocks became the mo@@ st-@@ used construction unit in the world .
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , one bri@@ ck at a time .
Es@@ senti@@ ally concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
Almost a hundred years later in 1947 , LE@@ GO came up with this .
It was called the Autom@@ atic Bin@@ ding Bri@@ ck .
And in a few short years , LE@@ GO bri@@ cks took place in every household .
It &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet .
You don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
LE@@ GO made it accessible .
LE@@ GO has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
Meanwhile the exact same year , at B@@ ell Lab@@ s the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
The transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bri@@ cks pil@@ ed on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
Like the concrete block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows you to build much larger , more complex circu@@ its , one bri@@ ck at a time .
But there &apos;s a main difference : The transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
I personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so I decided to change that .
Ei@@ ght years ago when I was at the Media Lab , I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
A few years ago I started developing litt@@ le@@ B@@ its .
Let me show you how they work .
L@@ itt@@ le@@ B@@ its are electronic modules with each one specific function .
They &apos;re pre-@@ engine@@ ered to be light , sound , mot@@ ors and sensors .
And the best part about it is they sn@@ ap together with magn@@ ets .
So you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
The bri@@ cks are col@@ or-@@ co@@ ded .
Green is output , blue is power , p@@ ink is input and orange is wire .
So all you need to do is sn@@ ap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circu@@ its .
You put a blue to a green , you can make light .
You can put a kno@@ b in between and now you &apos;ve made a little di@@ mmer .
Swi@@ t@@ ch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se module , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blin@@ ker .
Add this bu@@ z@@ zer for some extra p@@ unch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
I &apos;m going to stop that .
So beyond simple play , litt@@ le@@ B@@ its are actually pretty powerful .
Instead of having to program , to wire , to sol@@ der , litt@@ le@@ B@@ its allow you to program using very simple intuitive gest@@ ures .
So to make this b@@ link faster or s@@ lower , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or s@@ lower .
The idea behind litt@@ le@@ B@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing library .
We want to make every single interaction in the world into a read@@ y-to-@@ use bri@@ ck .
Li@@ ghts , sounds , solar panels , mot@@ ors -- everything should be accessible .
We &apos;ve been giving litt@@ le@@ B@@ its to kids and seeing them play with them .
And it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
The nic@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
For example , how a night@@ light works , or why an elev@@ ator door stays open , or how an iPod respon@@ ds to touch .
We &apos;ve also been taking litt@@ le@@ B@@ its to design schools .
So for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with litt@@ le@@ B@@ its as a material .
Here you see , with felt and paper water bott@@ les , we have Geor@@ die making ...
A few weeks ago we took litt@@ le@@ B@@ its to R@@ IS@@ D and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just card@@ board , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; Make something . &quot;
Here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a mo@@ tion-@@ activated conf@@ etti can@@ on ball .
But wait , this is actually my favorite project .
It &apos;s a lob@@ ster made of play@@ d@@ ough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
To these non-@@ engineers , litt@@ le@@ B@@ its became another material , electronics became just another material .
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
So litt@@ le@@ B@@ its is open-@@ source .
You can go on the website , download all the design files , make them yourself .
We want to encourage a world of cre@@ ators , of invent@@ ors , of contribut@@ ors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
So go ahead and start inv@@ enting .
Thank you .
