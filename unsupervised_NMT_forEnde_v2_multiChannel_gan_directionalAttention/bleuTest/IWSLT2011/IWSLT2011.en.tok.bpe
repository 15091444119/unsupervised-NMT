How would you like to be better than you are ?
Sup@@ pose I said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory -- more precise , more accurate and qu@@ icker .
Or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stronger , with more st@@ am@@ ina .
Would you like to be more attractive and self-@@ confident ?
How about living longer with good health ?
Or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always year@@ ned for more creativity .
Which one would you like the most ?
Which would you like , if you could have just one ?
Cre@@ ativity .
How many people would choose creativity ?
Ra@@ ise your hands . Let me see .
A few . Prob@@ ably about as many as there are creative people here .
That &apos;s very good .
How many would opt for memory ?
Quite a few more .
How about fitness ?
A few less .
What about lon@@ ge@@ vity ?
A@@ h , the majority . That makes me feel very good as a doctor .
If you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
Is it just imag@@ inary ?
Or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
Evolution has been a per@@ enni@@ al topic here at the T@@ ED Conference , but I want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject .
The great 20@@ th-@@ century gene@@ tic@@ ist , T@@ .@@ G. D@@ ob@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a communic@@ ant in the Russian Or@@ thodo@@ x Church , once wrote an ess@@ ay that he ti@@ tled &quot; Nothing in Bi@@ ology M@@ akes S@@ ense Exc@@ ept in the Light of Evolution . &quot;
Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communications device -- I give you permission -- and perhaps take another look at Kath@@ r@@ yn Sch@@ ult@@ z &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you .
But if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
Does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
This is another look at the tree of life .
In this picture , I &apos;ve put a b@@ ush with a center bran@@ ching out in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolu@@ tionary terms : it has survi@@ ved ; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment .
The human part of this branch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
We branch off of a common ancest@@ or to modern ch@@ imp@@ anz@@ ees about six or eight million years ago .
In the inter@@ val , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
Some have come and gone .
We have been here for about 13@@ 0@@ ,000 years .
It may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same .
Do you realize that we can take advantage and comm@@ an@@ de@@ er the machinery of a common bacter@@ ium to produce the protein of human in@@ su@@ lin used to treat di@@ ab@@ e@@ tics ?
This is not like human in@@ su@@ lin ; this is the same protein that is chem@@ ically indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from what comes out of your pan@@ cre@@ as .
And speaking of bacter@@ ia , do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacter@@ ia than there are cells in the rest of our body ?
Maybe 10 times more .
I mean think of it , when Antonio Dam@@ asi@@ o asks about your self-@@ image , do you think about the bacter@@ ia ?
Our gut is a wonder@@ fully hosp@@ itable environment for those bacter@@ ia .
It &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s mo@@ ist , it &apos;s very cozy .
And you &apos;re going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
It &apos;s really like an Easy Street for bacter@@ ia , with the occa@@ sional inter@@ ruption of the un@@ intended forced r@@ ush to the exit .
But otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacter@@ ia , just as they are essential to your life .
They help in the di@@ ges@@ tion of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect you against certain diseases .
But what will come in the future ?
Are we at some kind of evolu@@ tionary equi@@ po@@ ise as a species ?
Or , are we dest@@ ined to become something different -- something , perhaps , even better adapted to the environment ?
Now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the Big B@@ ang , 14 billion years ago -- the Earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of pro@@ to-@@ life , maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth -- the first multi-@@ cell@@ ed organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 13@@ 0@@ ,000 years .
In this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on Earth is like a brief measure ; the animal kingdom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small grace note .
That was us .
That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk , so I hope you enjoyed it .
Now when I was a fresh@@ man in college , I took my first bi@@ ology class .
I was fascin@@ ated by the elegance and beauty of bi@@ ology .
I became en@@ am@@ ored of the power of evolution , and I realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in single-@@ cell@@ ed organisms , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells .
But at the time multi-@@ cell@@ ed organisms come online , things start to change .
Sex@@ ual reproduction enters the picture .
And very importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the gen@@ ome , the rest of the body becomes exp@@ end@@ able .
In fact , you could say that the inev@@ it@@ ability of the death of our bodies enters in evolu@@ tionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction .
Now I have to conf@@ ess , when I was a college under@@ graduate , I thought , ok@@ ay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with each passing year , I &apos;ve come to have increasing doubts .
I &apos;ve come to understand the sen@@ tim@@ ents of George Bur@@ ns , who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 9@@ 0s .
And one night , there &apos;s a kno@@ ck at his hotel room door .
He answers the door .
Stand@@ ing before him is a gor@@ ge@@ ous , s@@ can@@ ti@@ ly cla@@ d show@@ girl .
She looks at him and says , &quot; I &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s fine , &quot; says George , &quot; I &apos;ll take the sou@@ p . &quot;
I came to realize , as a physi@@ cian , that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradic@@ tory , just different .
I was trying to preserve the body .
I wanted to keep us healthy .
I wanted to restore health from disease .
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
Evolution is all about passing on the gen@@ ome to the next generation , adapting and survi@@ ving through generation after generation .
From an evolu@@ tionary point of view , you and I are like the boo@@ ster ro@@ ckets designed to send the genetic pay@@ load into the next level of or@@ bit and then drop off into the sea .
I think we would all understand the sen@@ timent that Woo@@ dy Al@@ len expressed when he said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to achieve im@@ mort@@ ality through my work .
I want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
Evolution does not necessarily favor the lon@@ gest@@ -@@ lived .
It doesn &apos;t necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest , and not even the sm@@ art@@ est .
Evolution favor@@ s those creatures best adapted to their environment .
That is the sole test of survival and success .
At the bottom of the ocean , bacter@@ ia that are ther@@ m@@ ophi@@ lic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ vi@@ de co@@ oked fish , nevertheless , have managed to make that a hosp@@ itable environment for them .
So what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , I would say that there are a number of possibilities .
The first is that we will not evol@@ ve .
We have reached a kind of equi@@ po@@ ise .
And the reason@@ ing behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population .
And secondly , we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it .
And by the way , we im@@ migr@@ ate and circul@@ ate and inter@@ mix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , imposed by the forces of nature .
And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution gr@@ ind slowly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
And as far as isolation goes , when we as a species do col@@ oni@@ ze distant plan@@ ets , there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
But there &apos;s a third possibility , an en@@ tic@@ ing , in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ gh@@ tening possibility .
I call it neo-@@ evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
Now how could this come about ?
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
Consi@@ der , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their off@@ spring .
They &apos;re , in some cultures , choosing to have more m@@ ales than fem@@ ales .
It &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choosing .
Th@@ ink also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases .
What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate di@@ abetes or Alz@@ heimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stro@@ ke ?
W@@ ouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
If we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
The Human Gen@@ ome Project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
It cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
The year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
Today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base p@@ airs in the human gen@@ ome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
It won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dollar human gen@@ ome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
Just a week ago , the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Dra@@ per Prize to Franc@@ is Arn@@ old and Wil@@ lem St@@ em@@ mer , two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable prot@@ eins in a more efficient way -- what Fran@@ ces Arn@@ old calls &quot; directed evolution . &quot;
A couple of years ago , the Las@@ ker Prize was awarded to the scienti@@ st Shin@@ ya Y@@ aman@@ aka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fi@@ bro@@ b@@ last , and by manipul@@ ating just four genes , he in@@ duced that cell to rever@@ t to a pl@@ uri@@ potential stem cell -- a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
These changes are coming .
The same technology that has produced the human in@@ su@@ lin in bacter@@ ia can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but indu@@ ce immunity against other viruses .
Bel@@ ieve it or not , there &apos;s an experimental trial going on with vacc@@ ine against influ@@ enza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant .
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
These are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be ever@@ more possible .
Imag@@ ine then just two other little changes .
You can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ spring ?
What if you could change the sper@@ m and the ova , or change the newly fertili@@ zed egg , and give your off@@ spring a better chance at a health@@ ier life -- eliminate the di@@ abetes , eliminate the hem@@ ophi@@ lia , reduce the risk of cancer ?
Who doesn &apos;t want health@@ ier children ?
And then , that same analy@@ tic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also enable us to adopt super@@ -@@ attributes , hyper@@ -@@ capacities -- that better memory .
Why not have the quick wi@@ t of a K@@ en J@@ enn@@ ings , especially if you can au@@ g@@ ment it with the next generation of the Watson machine ?
Why not have the quick twi@@ t@@ ch mus@@ cle that will enable you to run faster and longer ?
Why not live longer ?
These will be ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble .
And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes we want , we will have converted ol@@ d-@@ style evolution into neo-@@ evolution .
We &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100@@ ,000 years , and we can com@@ press it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
These are choices that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them .
Will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kin@@ der ?
Or , will we sel@@ ectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?
Will we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uniform , or more robust and more versatile ?
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
And most pro@@ found@@ ly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to inher@@ it the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wis@@ ely ?
For better or worse , and sooner than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
Thank you .
I want you now to imagine a we@@ ar@@ able ro@@ bot that gives you super@@ human abilities , or another one that takes whe@@ el@@ chair users up standing and walking again .
We at Ber@@ kel@@ ey Bi@@ on@@ ics call these robots exo@@ sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons .
These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further enhance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
But not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
This is just not some blue sky thinking .
To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldi@@ er , that on average does carry about 100 l@@ bs@@ . on their backs , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
Obviously , this is resulting in some major complic@@ ations -- back in@@ jur@@ ies , 30 percent of them -- chronic back in@@ jur@@ ies .
So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exo@@ sk@@ el@@ et@@ on that would help deal with this issue .
So let me now introduce to you H@@ UL@@ C -- or the Human Universal Lo@@ ad Carri@@ er .
Sol@@ di@@ er : With the H@@ UL@@ C exo@@ sk@@ el@@ et@@ on , I can carry 200 l@@ bs@@ . over varied terrain for many hours .
Its flexible design allows for deep squ@@ ats , cra@@ w@@ ls and high-@@ ag@@ ility movements .
It senses what I want to do , where I want to go , and then au@@ g@@ ments my strength and end@@ urance .
E@@ y@@ th@@ or Ben@@ der : We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new exo@@ sk@@ el@@ et@@ on this year .
So this is for real .
Now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the whe@@ el@@ chair users , something that I &apos;m particularly passion@@ ate about .
There are 68 million people estimated to be in whe@@ el@@ chairs worldwide .
This is about one percent of the total population .
And that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
We are talking here about , of@@ ten@@ times , very young individuals with sp@@ inal cor@@ d in@@ jur@@ ies , that in the prime of their life -- 20@@ s , 30@@ s , 4@@ 0s -- hit a wall and the whe@@ el@@ chair &apos;s the only option .
But it is also the aging population that is multi@@ pl@@ ying in numbers .
And the only option , pretty much -- when it &apos;s stro@@ ke or other complic@@ ations -- is the whe@@ el@@ chair .
And that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introduction , I must say .
So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility .
Let me now introduce you to e@@ LE@@ GS that is worn by Am@@ anda Bo@@ x@@ tel that 19 years ago was sp@@ inal cor@@ d injured , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
Am@@ anda Bo@@ x@@ tel : Thank you .
E@@ B : Am@@ anda is wearing our e@@ LE@@ GS set .
It has sensors .
It &apos;s completely non-@@ inv@@ asi@@ ve , sensors in the cr@@ ut@@ ches that send signals back to our on@@ board computer that is sitting here at her back .
There are battery p@@ acks here as well that power mot@@ ors that are sitting at her hi@@ ps , as well as her kne@@ e jo@@ ints , that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural ga@@ it .
I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a fre@@ ak sum@@ mer@@ s@@ ault while down@@ hill skiing par@@ aly@@ zed me .
In a split second , I lost all sens@@ ation and movement below my pel@@ vis .
Not long afterwards , a doctor stro@@ de into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; Am@@ anda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
And that was 19 ye@@ as ago .
He rob@@ bed every ounce of hope from my being .
Adap@@ tive technology has since enabled me to learn how to down@@ hill ski again , to rock climb and even hand@@ cycle .
But nothing has been invented that enables me to walk , until now .
Thank you .
E@@ B : As you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you .
It &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for Am@@ anda here and all the whe@@ el@@ chair users , but for everyone .
Thanks .
Back in New York , I am the head of development for a non-@@ profit called Rob@@ in H@@ ood .
When I &apos;m not fighting poverty , I &apos;m fighting fires as the assi@@ stant cap@@ tain of a volunte@@ er fire company .
Now in our town , where the volunte@@ ers supplement a highly skilled career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
I remember my first fire .
I was the second volunte@@ er on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in .
But still it was a real foot@@ race against the other volunte@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in charge to find out what our assign@@ ments would be .
When I found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very eng@@ aging conversation with the home@@ owner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life .
Here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the po@@ uring rain , under an umbr@@ ella , in her pa@@ j@@ amas , bar@@ ef@@ oot , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
The other volunte@@ er who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him L@@ ex Lu@@ ther -- got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and save the home@@ owner &apos;s dog .
The dog ! I was st@@ un@@ ned with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
Here was some lawyer or money manager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature , just because he beat me by five seconds .
Well , I was next .
The cap@@ tain wav@@ ed me over .
He said , &quot; Be@@ z@@ os , I need you to go into the house .
I need you to go up@@ stairs , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
I swe@@ ar .
So , not exactly what I was hoping for , but off I went -- up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; fire@@ figh@@ ters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no her@@ o .
I carried my pay@@ load back down@@ stairs where I met my n@@ em@@ esis and the precious dog by the front door .
We took our treas@@ ures outside to the home@@ owner , where , not surpris@@ ingly , his received much more attention than did mine .
A few weeks later , the department received a letter from the home@@ owner thanking us for the vali@@ ant effort displayed in saving her home .
The act of kin@@ dness she noted above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
In both my vocation at Rob@@ in H@@ ood and my av@@ oc@@ ation as a volunte@@ er fire@@ figh@@ ter , I am witness to acts of gener@@ o@@ sity and kin@@ dness on a monum@@ ental scale , but I &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis .
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved , or are on their way to achieving , remarkable levels of success , I would offer this remin@@ der : don &apos;t wait .
Don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
If you have something to give , give it now .
Ser@@ ve food at a sou@@ p kitchen . Clean up a neighborhood park .
Be a ment@@ or .
Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .
So get in the game . Save the shoes .
Thank you .
Brun@@ o Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Mark , Mark , come back .
Mark Be@@ z@@ os : Thank you .
I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival .
It &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say h@@ ello , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
And no , this isn &apos;t Bur@@ ning Man or San Francisco .
Ladies and gentlemen , meet your c@@ ous@@ ins .
This is the world of wild bon@@ ob@@ os in the jung@@ les of Congo .
Bon@@ ob@@ os are , together with ch@@ imp@@ anz@@ ees , your living closest relative .
That means we all share a common ancest@@ or , an evolu@@ tionary grand@@ mother , who lived around six million years ago .
Now , ch@@ imp@@ anz@@ ees are well-known for their aggres@@ sion .
But unfortunately , we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our nar@@ rati@@ ves of human evolution .
But bon@@ ob@@ os show us the other side of the coin .
While ch@@ imp@@ anz@@ ees are dominated by big , sc@@ ary guys , bon@@ ob@@ o society is run by em@@ powered fem@@ ales .
These guys have really worked something out , since this leads to a highly toler@@ ant society where fat@@ al violence has not been observed yet .
But unfortunately , bon@@ ob@@ os are the least understood of the great ap@@ es .
They live in the dep@@ ths of the Con@@ gol@@ ese jung@@ le , and it has been very difficult to study them .
The Congo is a parad@@ ox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of dark@@ ness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has ra@@ ged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War .
Not surpris@@ ingly , this destruction also end@@ angers bon@@ ob@@ o survival .
Bus@@ h@@ meat tra@@ des and forest loss means we couldn &apos;t fill a small stadium with all the bon@@ ob@@ os that are left in the world -- and we &apos;re not even sure of that to be honest .
Yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden lau@@ ghter sw@@ aying the trees .
Who are these c@@ ous@@ ins ?
We know them as the &quot; make love , not war &quot; ap@@ es since they have frequent , promis@@ cu@@ ous and bis@@ ex@@ ual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
Now , I &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bon@@ ob@@ o life than the K@@ ama S@@ ut@@ ra .
Bon@@ ob@@ os , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
Play is not just child &apos;s games .
For us and them , play is found@@ ational for bon@@ ding relationships and fo@@ stering tolerance .
It &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
Play increases creativity and res@@ ili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of behavi@@ ors , diversity of connections .
And when you watch bon@@ ob@@ o play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolu@@ tionary roots of human lau@@ ghter , dance and rit@@ ual .
Play is the glu@@ e that bin@@ ds us together .
Now , I don &apos;t know how you play , but I want to show you a couple of unique cli@@ ps fresh from the wild .
First , it &apos;s a ball game bon@@ ob@@ o-@@ style -- and I do not mean football .
So here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a ch@@ ase game .
Have a look what she &apos;s doing .
It might be the evolu@@ tionary origin of the phrase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the balls . &quot;
Only I think that he &apos;s rather lo@@ ving it here , right ?
Y@@ e@@ ah .
So sex play is common in both bon@@ ob@@ os and humans .
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inven@@ tiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as tes@@ tic@@ les -- and also how play both requires trust and fo@@ sters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
But play &apos;s a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ fter .
Play &apos;s a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ fter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quiet , imagin@@ ative , cur@@ ious -- maybe where wonder is discovered ane@@ w .
And I want you to see , this is Fu@@ ku , a young female , and she is quiet@@ ly playing with water .
I think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds .
And it &apos;s that play@@ ful cur@@ io@@ sity that drives us to explore , drives us to inter@@ act , and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hot@@ bed for creativity .
So these are just small ta@@ sters into the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ ob@@ o give us to our past and present .
But they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation .
The secret is that play is the key to these capacities .
In other words , play is our adap@@ tive wild@@ card .
In order to adapt successfully to a changing world , we need to play .
But will we make the most of our play@@ ful@@ ness ?
Play is not fri@@ vol@@ ous .
Play &apos;s essential .
For bon@@ ob@@ os and humans alike , life is not just red in t@@ ooth and c@@ law .
In times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most urgent .
And so , my fellow prim@@ ates , let us embra@@ ce this gift from evolution and play together , as we re@@ discover creativity , fel@@ low@@ ship and wonder .
Thank you .
I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day , at the exact same moment , each concei@@ ving a baby -- ok@@ ay ?
So two couples each concei@@ ving one baby .
Now I don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imag@@ ining the conception , because if you spend all that time imag@@ ining that conception , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
So just imagine that for a moment .
And in this scenario , I want to imagine that , in one case , the sper@@ m is carrying a Y ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some , meeting that X ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some of the egg .
And in the other case , the sper@@ m is carrying an X ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some , meeting the X ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some of the egg .
Both are viable ; both take off .
We &apos;ll come back to these people later .
So I wear two h@@ ats in most of what I do .
As the one hat , I do history of an@@ atom@@ y .
I &apos;m a hist@@ orian by training , and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with an@@ atom@@ y -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they dealt with bo@@ di@@ ly flu@@ ids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
The other hat that I &apos;ve worn in my work is as an activ@@ ist , as a patient advocate -- or , as I sometimes say , as an imp@@ ati@@ ent advocate -- for people who are patients of doctors .
In that case , what I &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms .
So some of what I &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are con@@ joined tw@@ ins -- two people within one body .
Some of what I &apos;ve worked on is people who have d@@ war@@ f@@ ism -- so people who are much shorter than typical .
And a lot of what I &apos;ve worked on is people who have at@@ yp@@ ical sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
And as a general term , we can use the term inter@@ sex for this .
Inter@@ sex comes in a lot of different forms .
I &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female .
So in one instance , you can have somebody who has an X@@ Y ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ al basis , and that SR@@ Y gene on the Y ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some tells the pro@@ to-@@ gon@@ ads , which we all have in the f@@ etal life , to become test@@ es .
And so in the f@@ etal life the test@@ es are p@@ umping out test@@ o@@ ster@@ one .
But because this individual lacks rec@@ ept@@ ors to hear that test@@ o@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t react to the test@@ o@@ ster@@ one .
And this is a syn@@ dro@@ me called and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensitivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
So lots of levels of test@@ o@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to it .
As a consequence , the body develops more along the female typical path .
When the child is born , she looks like a girl .
She is a girl . She is raised as a girl .
And it &apos;s often not until she h@@ its pu@@ ber@@ ty and she &apos;s growing and developing bre@@ asts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody figures out something &apos;s up here .
And they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having o@@ varies inside and a uter@@ us , she actually has test@@ es inside , and she has a Y ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some .
Now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not .
F@@ em@@ ales , like m@@ ales , have in our bodies something called the ad@@ ren@@ al g@@ lands .
They &apos;re in the back of our body .
And the ad@@ ren@@ al g@@ lands make and@@ ro@@ gens , which are a mas@@ cul@@ ini@@ zing hor@@ m@@ one .
Most fem@@ ales like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female -- I don &apos;t actually know my ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ al ma@@ ke-@@ up but I think I &apos;m probably typical -- most fem@@ ales like me are actually and@@ ro@@ gen-@@ sensitive .
We &apos;re making and@@ ro@@ gen , and we &apos;re responding to and@@ ro@@ gens .
The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more and@@ ro@@ gens than the woman born with test@@ es who has and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensitivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
So sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that inter@@ sex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
Another example : a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had o@@ varies and a uter@@ us inside .
What he had was an extreme form of a condition called con@@ gen@@ ital ad@@ ren@@ al hyper@@ pl@@ asi@@ a .
He had X@@ X ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , and in the wom@@ b , his ad@@ ren@@ al g@@ lands were in such high gear that it created , essentially , a mas@@ cul@@ ine hormon@@ al environment .
And as a consequence , his gen@@ it@@ als were mas@@ cul@@ in@@ zed , his brain was subject to the more typical mas@@ cul@@ ine component of hormon@@ es .
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody susp@@ ected anything .
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from men@@ stru@@ ating internally , that doctors figur@@ ed out that , in fact , he was female internally .
Ok@@ ay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have inter@@ sex .
Some people who have X@@ X ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es develop what are called o@@ vot@@ esti@@ s , which is when you have o@@ vari@@ an tissue with tes@@ tic@@ ular tissue wra@@ pped around it .
And we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
So sex can come in lots of different varieties .
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ f@@ ism , or it &apos;s con@@ joined tw@@ inning , or it &apos;s an inter@@ sex type -- are often norm@@ alized by sur@@ ge@@ ons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
In many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
The reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of sur@@ geri@@ es is because they threaten our social categories .
Or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of an@@ atom@@ y comes with a particular identity .
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity ; what it means to be a black person is , alle@@ ge@@ dly , is to have an African an@@ atom@@ y in terms of your history .
And so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ stic idea .
And when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different , it star@@ t@@ les us in terms of those categ@@ oriz@@ ations .
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individu@@ alism .
And our nation &apos;s really founded on a very romantic concept of individu@@ alism .
Well you can imagine how star@@ t@@ ling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African run@@ ner , C@@ aster Sem@@ en@@ ya , had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin .
I had a lot of journalists calling me , asking me , &quot; Which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not C@@ aster Sem@@ en@@ ya is male or female ? &quot;
And I had to explain to the journalists there isn &apos;t such a test .
In fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex and female and inter@@ sex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
So what we have is a sort of situation where the far@@ ther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable an@@ atom@@ ical categories that ma@@ pped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fu@@ zz@@ y than we thought .
And it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
It &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out to be v@@ ast@@ ly more complicated than our termin@@ ology has allowed .
As we look , we get into all sorts of un@@ comfortable areas .
We look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with ch@@ imp@@ anz@@ ees .
What are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nu@@ cle@@ oti@@ des ?
And as we get far@@ ther and far@@ ther with our science , we get more and more into a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simpli@@ stic categories we &apos;ve had are probably over@@ ly simpli@@ stic .
So we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
One of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the United States today , is batt@@ les over the beginning of life and the end of life .
We have difficult convers@@ ations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a f@@ etal life .
We have very difficult convers@@ ations nowadays -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody &apos;s dead .
In the past , our ancest@@ ors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
At most , they &apos;d stick a fe@@ ather on somebody &apos;s nose , and if it twi@@ t@@ ched , they didn &apos;t bury them yet .
If it stopped twi@@ t@@ ching , you bury them .
But today , we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings .
And as a consequence , we &apos;re stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categories as we &apos;ve had before .
Now you might think that all this break@@ ing-@@ down of categories would make somebody like me really happy .
I &apos;m a political progressive , I defend people with unusual bodies , but I have to admit to you that it makes me ner@@ vous .
Under@@ standing that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me ten@@ se .
And it makes me ten@@ se from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
So in order to tell you about that tension , I have to first admit to you that I &apos;m a huge fan of the Found@@ ing F@@ ath@@ ers .
I know they were ra@@ ci@@ sts , I know they were sex@@ ist , but they were great .
I mean , they were so bra@@ ve and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that che@@ es@@ y musical &quot; 17@@ 76 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally for@@ get@@ table .
It &apos;s because of what happened in 17@@ 76 with the Found@@ ing F@@ ath@@ ers .
The Found@@ ing F@@ ath@@ ers were , for my point of view , the original an@@ atom@@ ical activists , and this is why .
What they rejected was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
So as you all recall , what our Found@@ ing F@@ ath@@ ers were rej@@ ecting was a concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was basically based on a very simpli@@ stic concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
The mon@@ arch@@ s of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of DNA , but they did have a concept of birth@@ right .
They had a concept of blue blood .
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grand@@ father to father to son and so forth .
The Found@@ ing F@@ ath@@ ers rejected that idea , and they replaced it with a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
They le@@ vel@@ ed that playing field and decided the an@@ atom@@ y that mat@@ tered was the comm@@ on@@ ality of an@@ atom@@ y , not the difference in an@@ atom@@ y , and that was a really radical thing to do .
Now they were doing it in part because they were part of an En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment system where two things were growing up together .
And that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
And it &apos;s really clear , if you look at the history of the Found@@ ing F@@ ath@@ ers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ alistic world .
They were moving away from super@@ natural explanations , and they were rej@@ ecting things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birth@@ right .
They were moving towards a natur@@ alistic concept .
And if you look , for example , in the Declaration of In@@ dependence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s God .
They don &apos;t talk about God and God &apos;s nature .
They &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
So as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about an@@ atom@@ ical comm@@ on@@ ality .
And in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights movement of the future .
They didn &apos;t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
So what happened years after@@ ward ?
What happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the Found@@ ing F@@ ath@@ ers &apos; concept of an@@ atom@@ ical comm@@ on@@ ality being more important than an@@ atom@@ ical difference and said , &quot; The fact that we have a uter@@ us and o@@ varies is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citizenship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot;
And women successfully argued that .
Next came the successful Civil Rights movement , where we found people like So@@ jour@@ ner Tru@@ th talking about , &quot; A@@ in &apos;t I a woman ? &quot;
We find men on the mar@@ ching lines of the Civil Rights movement saying , &quot; I am a man . &quot;
Again , people of color appealing to a comm@@ on@@ ality of an@@ atom@@ y over a difference of an@@ atom@@ y , again , successfully .
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement .
The problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that comm@@ on@@ ality , we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions .
Now mind you , I want to maintain some divisions , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
For example , I don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
I don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on an@@ atom@@ y .
I don &apos;t want to say five-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to mar@@ ry .
So there are some an@@ atom@@ ical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain .
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning .
So let &apos;s go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk .
We have two beings , both conceived in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day .
Let &apos;s imagine one of them , Mary , is born three months pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely , so she &apos;s born on June 1 , 1980 .
Henry , by contrast , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on March 1 , 1980 .
Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does -- the right to consent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink .
Henry has to wait for all of that , not because he &apos;s actually any different in age , bi@@ ologically , except in terms of when he was born .
We find other kinds of wei@@ r@@ dness in terms of what their rights are .
Henry , by virtue of being assumed to be male -- although I haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the X@@ Y one -- by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted , which Mary does not need to worry about .
Mary , mean@@ while , cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states , namely , the right to mar@@ ry .
Henry can mar@@ ry in every state a woman , but Mary can only mar@@ ry today in a few states a woman .
So we have these an@@ atom@@ ical categories that pers@@ ist that are in many ways problematic and question@@ able .
And the question to me becomes : What do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at an@@ atom@@ y , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on an@@ atom@@ y might start falling apart ?
I don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
So where do we go ?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude : &quot; Well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &quot;
But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
So for example , Texas has at one point decided that what it means to mar@@ ry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a Y ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some , and what it means to mar@@ ry a woman means you do have a Y ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some .
Now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es .
But this is also very bizarre , because of the story I told you at the beginning about and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensitivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
If we look at one of the founding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , Dr. Martin Lu@@ ther King , he offers us something of a solution in his &quot; I have a dream &quot; speech .
He says we should judge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond an@@ atom@@ y .
And I want to say , &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
But in practice , how do you do it ?
How do you judge people based on the content of character ?
I also want to point out that I &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans , because , I have to admit , that there are some golden retri@@ ever@@ s I know that are probably more deser@@ ving of social services than some humans I know .
I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Lab@@ rad@@ ors that I know that are more capable of informed , intelligent , mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds that I know .
So how do we operation@@ alize the question of content of character ?
It turns out to be really difficult .
And part of me also wonder@@ s , what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s scann@@ able in the future -- able to be seen with an f@@ M@@ RI ?
Do we really want to go there ?
I &apos;m not sure where we go .
What I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
We &apos;ve done a really good job stru@@ ggling with democracy , and I think we would do a good job in the future .
We don &apos;t have a situation that Iran has , for example , where a man who &apos;s sex@@ ually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered , unless he &apos;s willing to submit to a sex change , in which case he &apos;s allowed to live .
We don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
I &apos;m glad to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with -- a sur@@ ge@@ on I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of con@@ joined tw@@ ins in order to separate them , partly to make a name for himself .
But when I was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-@@ risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very badly , and so he had to do this .
My response to him was , &quot; Well , have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery ? &quot;
The United States has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are , without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state .
So I think we have to be in the lead .
Well , just to close , I want to suggest to you that I &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fa@@ thers .
And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a femin@@ ist , and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that can come from different kinds of an@@ atom@@ ies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
Now for years , because I &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sex , I &apos;ve also been interested in sex difference research .
And one of the things that I &apos;ve been really interested in is looking at the differences between m@@ ales and fem@@ ales in terms of the way they think and operate in the world .
And what we know from cross-@@ cultural studies is that fem@@ ales , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more inc@@ lined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
And so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
Y@@ ears ago , when I was in graduate school , one of my graduate advis@@ ers who knew I was interested in femin@@ ism -- I considered myself a femin@@ ist , as I still do -- asked a really strange question .
He said , &quot; T@@ ell me what &apos;s femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism . &quot;
And I thought , &quot; Well that &apos;s the dum@@ best question I &apos;ve ever heard .
F@@ emin@@ ism is all about und@@ o@@ ing ster@@ e@@ otyp@@ es about gender , so there &apos;s nothing femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism . &quot;
But the more I thought about his question , the more I thought there might be something femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism .
That is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female bra@@ ins from male bra@@ ins that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable .
So whereas the fa@@ thers were extremely attentive to fig@@ uring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we inj@@ ected more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
And maybe that &apos;s where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond an@@ atom@@ y , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identity , and think more about those relationships .
So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other .
Thank you .
As an artist , connection is very important to me .
Through my work I &apos;m trying to artic@@ ulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is inter@@ connected .
I first went to Ant@@ arc@@ tica almost 10 years ago , where I saw my first ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs .
I was in a@@ we .
My heart beat fast , my head was di@@ zz@@ y , trying to compreh@@ end what it was that stood in front of me .
The ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and I could only help but wonder that this was one snow@@ fl@@ ake on top of another snow@@ fl@@ ake , year after year .
I@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs are born when they cal@@ ve off of gl@@ aci@@ ers or break off of ice shel@@ ves .
Each ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual personality .
They have a distinct way of inter@@ acting with their environment and their experiences .
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and cru@@ m@@ ble in a fit of dramatic passion .
It &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , that they &apos;re isolated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
But the reality is far from it .
As an ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , I am brea@@ thing in its ancient atmosphere .
As the ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , it is rel@@ easing miner@@ al-@@ rich fresh water that no@@ ur@@ ishes many forms of life .
I approach photograph@@ ing these ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs as if I &apos;m making portra@@ its of my ancest@@ ors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
It is not a death when they m@@ elt ; it is not an end , but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life .
Some of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs that I phot@@ ograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
And some of the ice is over 100@@ ,000 years old .
The last pictures I &apos;d like to show you are of an ic@@ e@@ berg that I photograph@@ ed in Q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q , Gre@@ enland .
It &apos;s a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an ic@@ e@@ berg rolling .
So here it is .
You can see on the left side a small boat .
That &apos;s about a 15-@@ foot boat .
And I &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it is at the water@@ line .
You can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
This is an aver@@ age-@@ size Green@@ lan@@ dic ic@@ e@@ berg .
It &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
And this video is real time .
And just like that , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you a different side of its personality .
Thank you .
I &apos;m J@@ essi , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
But before I show you what I &apos;ve got inside , I &apos;m going to make a very public con@@ fes@@ sion , and that is , I &apos;m out@@ fit@@ -@@ obs@@ essed .
I love finding , wearing , and more recently , photograph@@ ing and blo@@ gging a different , color@@ ful , cra@@ zy out@@ fit for every single occasion .
But I don &apos;t buy anything new .
I get all my clothes sec@@ ond@@ hand from fle@@ a markets and th@@ rift stores .
A@@ w@@ w , thank you .
Sec@@ ond@@ hand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my war@@ dro@@ be has on the environment and on my wal@@ let .
I get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; I look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping like my own personal treas@@ ure h@@ unt .
I mean , what am I going to find today ?
Is it going to be my size ?
Will I like the color ?
Will it be under $ 20 ?
If all the answers are yes , I feel as though I &apos;ve won .
I want to get back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at T@@ ED .
I mean , what does somebody with all these out@@ fits bring with her ?
So I &apos;m going to show you exactly what I brought .
I brought seven p@@ airs of under@@ p@@ ants and that &apos;s it .
Ex@@ ac@@ tly one week &apos;s worth of un@@ dies is all I put in my su@@ it@@ case .
I was betting that I &apos;d be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Sp@@ rings .
And since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around T@@ ED in her under@@ wear -- that means I found a few things .
And I &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of out@@ fits right now .
Does that sound good ?
So as I do this , I &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , I have picked up in these adv@@ entures wearing nothing new .
So let &apos;s start with Sunday .
I call this &quot; Shin@@ y T@@ iger . &quot;
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
You can almost always look phenom@@ en@@ al for under $ 50 .
This whole out@@ fit , including the jack@@ et , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that I wor@@ e the entire week .
Monday : Color is powerful .
It is almost physi@@ ologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you &apos;re wearing bright red p@@ ants .
If you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
Tuesday : F@@ itting in is way over@@ rated .
I &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
Just be who you are .
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
Wednesday : Em@@ bra@@ ce your inner child .
Sometimes people tell me that I look like I &apos;m playing dres@@ s-@@ up , or that I remind them of their sev@@ en-@@ year-old .
I like to s@@ mile and say , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
Thursday : Con@@ fi@@ dence is key .
If you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
And if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
I grew up with a mo@@ m who taught me this da@@ y-@@ in and da@@ y-@@ out .
But it wasn &apos;t until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant .
And I &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
If you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience .
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
Thank you .
Friday : A universal truth -- five words for you : Gold sequ@@ ins go with everything .
And finally , Saturday : Develop@@ ing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
It &apos;s been proven to me time and time again as people have wal@@ ked up to me this week simply because of what I &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great convers@@ ations .
So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
So before I go home to Bro@@ o@@ kl@@ yn , I &apos;m going to don@@ ate everything back .
Because the lesson I &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s ok@@ ay to let go .
I don &apos;t need to get emo@@ tionally attached to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another cra@@ zy , color@@ ful , sh@@ iny out@@ fit just waiting for me , if I put a little love in my heart and look .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Good afternoon , everybody .
I &apos;ve got something to show you .
Th@@ ink about this as a pi@@ xel , a flying pi@@ xel .
This is what we call , in our l@@ ab , sensible design .
Let me tell you a bit about it .
Now if you take this picture -- I &apos;m Italian originally , and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom -- but the reason I &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formul@@ a 1 racing over the past couple of decades .
Now some time ago , if you wanted to win a Formul@@ a 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
And if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race .
Now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car , trans@@ mitting this information into the system , and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
This is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
And basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components -- a sens@@ ing and an actu@@ ating component .
What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
Our cities , over the past few years , just have been blan@@ k@@ eted with networks , electronics .
They &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
And , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sens@@ ed and to be actu@@ ated .
If we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
Just as an aside , I wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the Earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions .
So if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
Beyond cities , all of this sens@@ ing and actu@@ ating is entering our everyday objects .
That &apos;s from an exhibition that Pa@@ ola Ant@@ on@@ elli is organizing at Mo@@ MA later this year , during the summer .
It &apos;s called &quot; Tal@@ k to Me . &quot;
Well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
In a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actu@@ ator .
And that is radic@@ ally changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
In a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of Michel@@ angel@@ o ...
you know , when Michel@@ angel@@ o sculp@@ ted the Mo@@ ses , at the end it said that he took the h@@ ammer , thre@@ w it at the Mo@@ ses -- actually you can still see a small chip under@@ ne@@ ath -- and said , sh@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; Per@@ ch@@ é non par@@ li ? Why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
Well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
And I &apos;ll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sens@@ ing our environment and actu@@ ating it .
Let &apos;s starting with sens@@ ing .
Well , the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our l@@ ab .
It was four and a half years ago in Italy .
And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cell@@ phone network -- and use anonymous and aggreg@@ ated information from that network , that &apos;s collected anyway by the operator , in order to understand how the city works .
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
It &apos;s when Italy won the so@@ cc@@ er World Cup .
Some of you might remember , it was Italy and France playing , and then Zi@@ dan@@ e at the end , the head@@ but@@ t .
And anyway , Italy won at the end .
Now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network .
Here you see the city .
You see the C@@ olo@@ sse@@ um in the middle , the river Ti@@ ber .
It &apos;s morning , before the match .
You see the tim@@ eline on the top .
Early afternoon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
The match begins -- silence .
France scores . Italy scores .
Hal@@ f@@ time , people make a quick call and go to the bathroom .
Second half . End of normal time .
First over@@ time , second .
Zi@@ dan@@ e , the head@@ but@@ t in a moment .
Italy wins . Y@@ e@@ ah .
Well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
You saw the big peak .
The following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time .
And then everybody moved down .
You see the image of the place called Cir@@ co M@@ assi@@ mo , where , since Roman times , people go to celebrate , to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day .
Well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago .
Another quick example about sens@@ ing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consu@@ me .
Well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
This is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer , how they came together .
But we know very little about where things go .
So in this project , we actually developed some small tags to track tr@@ ash as it moves through the system .
So we actually started with a number of volunte@@ ers who helped us in Seattle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were thro@@ wing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway .
Then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the tr@@ ash and then started following it .
Here are the results we just obtained .
From Seattle ...
after one week .
With this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of in@@ effici@@ encies in the system .
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
This data was not available before .
But there &apos;s a lot of wast@@ ed transportation and con@@ vol@@ uted things happening .
But the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we &apos;re thro@@ wing away , it doesn &apos;t disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
And the plastic bottle we &apos;re thro@@ wing away every day still stays there .
And if we show that to people , then we can also promote some behavi@@ oral change .
So that was the reason for the project .
My colleague at M@@ IT , As@@ sa@@ f Bi@@ der@@ man , he could tell you much more about sens@@ ing and many other wonderful things we can do with sens@@ ing , but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actu@@ ating our environment .
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zar@@ ago@@ za , Spain .
It started with a question by the may@@ or of the city , who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture .
And the question was : How could technology , new technology , be added to that ?
And one of the ideas that was developed at M@@ IT in a workshop was , imagine this pipe , and you &apos;ve got val@@ ves , sol@@ en@@ o@@ id val@@ ves , t@@ aps , opening and closing .
You create like a water cur@@ tain with pixels made of water .
If those pixels fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
And even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jump through , as you see in this image .
Well , we presented this to Mayor Bel@@ lo@@ ch .
He liked it very much .
And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the exp@@ o .
We called it Digital Water Pavi@@ lion .
The whole building is made of water .
There &apos;s no doors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
The roof also is covered with water .
And if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to minim@@ ize sp@@ las@@ hing , you can actually lower the roof .
Or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappear , like in this case .
You know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; They demo@@ lished the building . &quot;
No , they didn &apos;t demo@@ lish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost dis@@ appears .
Here &apos;s the building working .
You see the person pu@@ zz@@ led about what was going on inside .
And here was myself trying not to get wet , testing the sensors that open the water .
Well , I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working .
But actually that night , it was even more fun .
All the kids from Zar@@ ago@@ za came to the building , because the way of eng@@ aging with the building became something different .
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting wet .
And that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
But then reality &apos;s always un@@ predictable .
And that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and inter@@ act with people .
Here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels , the pixels made of water , and then proj@@ ections on them .
And this is what led us to think about the following project I &apos;ll show you now .
That &apos;s , imagine those pixels could actually start flying .
Imag@@ ine you could have small helicop@@ ters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pi@@ xel in changing lights -- almost as a cl@@ oud that can move in space .
Here is the video .
So imagine one helicop@@ ter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in synchron@@ y .
So you can have this cl@@ oud .
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions .
Or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pixels &apos; position .
You can play with a different type .
Imag@@ ine your screen could just appear in different sc@@ ales or sizes , different types of resolution .
But then the whole thing can be just a 3D cl@@ oud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many directions .
Here is the real Fl@@ y@@ fire control and going down to form the regular grid as before .
When you turn on the light , actually you see this . So the same as we saw before .
And imagine each of them then controlled by people .
You can have each pi@@ xel having an input that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so .
I want to show you something here for the first time .
We &apos;ve been working with Rober@@ to B@@ olle , one of today &apos;s top bal@@ let dan@@ c@@ ers -- the é@@ to@@ ile at Metro@@ politan in New York and La Scal@@ a in Milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Fl@@ y@@ fire .
And here you can see Rober@@ to dancing .
You see on the left the pixels , the different resolutions being captured .
It &apos;s both 3D sc@@ anning in real time and motion capture .
So you can re@@ construct a whole movement .
You can go all the way through .
But then , once we have the pixels , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gra@@ vity and ro@@ tation .
So we want to use this as one of the possible in@@ puts for Fl@@ y@@ fire .
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
It &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the London Olymp@@ ics .
It &apos;s called The Cl@@ oud .
And the idea here is , imagine , again , we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to im@@ part what we call cl@@ oud raising -- like bar@@ n raising , but with a cl@@ oud .
Imag@@ ine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pi@@ xel .
And I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
This has been di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ing everything , knowledge , and making that accessible through the Internet .
Now today , for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self-@@ organizing power of networks , to the physical one .
This can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
That means something built in a city .
But tomorrow it can be , in order to tackle today &apos;s pressing challenges -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
So the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together , coll@@ ectively .
The cl@@ oud is a cl@@ oud , again , made of pixels , in the same way as the real cl@@ oud is a cl@@ oud made of partic@@ les .
And those partic@@ les are water , where our cl@@ oud is a cl@@ oud of pixels .
It &apos;s a physical structure in London , but covered with pixels .
You can move inside , have different types of experiences .
You can actually see from under@@ ne@@ ath , sharing the main moments for the Olymp@@ ics in 2012 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
So both the physical cl@@ oud in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like London &apos;s new moun@@ ta@@ int@@ op .
You can enter inside it .
And a kind of new digital be@@ acon for the night -- but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
Thank you .
I have had the distinct bl@@ essing in my life to have worked on a b@@ unch of amazing projects .
But the cool@@ est I ever worked on was around this guy .
This guy &apos;s name is TE@@ MP@@ T .
TE@@ MP@@ T was one of the foremost gra@@ ff@@ iti artists in the 8@@ 0s .
And he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; D@@ ad , my legs are t@@ ing@@ ling . &quot;
And that was the on@@ set of AL@@ S .
So TE@@ MP@@ T is now completely par@@ aly@@ zed .
He only has use of his eyes .
I was exposed to him .
I have a company that does design and animation , so obviously gra@@ ff@@ iti is definitely an in@@ tri@@ c@@ ate part of what we admire and respect in the art world .
And so we decided that we were going to spons@@ or Tony , TE@@ MP@@ T , and his cause .
So I went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to give you this money .
What are you going to do with it ? &quot;
And his brother said , &quot; I just want to be able to talk to Tony again .
I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Wa@@ it a second , isn &apos;t that -- I &apos;ve seen Stephen Ha@@ w@@ king -- don &apos;t all par@@ aly@@ zed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; No , unless you &apos;re in the upper ech@@ el@@ on and you &apos;ve got really amazing insurance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
These devices aren &apos;t accessible to people . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
Has everyone seen the movie &quot; The Di@@ ving B@@ ell and the But@@ ter@@ fly ? &quot;
That &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
I said , &quot; That &apos;s arch@@ a@@ ic . How can that be ? &quot;
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , I wrote a check that I had no fre@@ aking idea how I was going to cash .
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there -- I &apos;m like , &quot; All right , here &apos;s the deal : Tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
Because it &apos;s a trav@@ esty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
I met these guys called GR@@ L , Gra@@ ff@@ iti Research Lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a laser poin@@ ter , draw on it , and it just regi@@ sters the negative space .
So they go around and do art installations like this .
All the things that go up there , they said there &apos;s a life cycle .
First it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with c@@ uss words , then it was Bush sl@@ anders and then people actually got to art .
But there was always a life cycle to their presentations .
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; Well wait a second . If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for TE@@ MP@@ T to control a laser and he could do gra@@ f again ? Well that would be a@@ wes@@ ome . &quot;
So that started the journey .
And about two years later , about a year later , after a b@@ unch of organization and a b@@ unch of moving things around , we &apos;d accomplished a couple things .
One , we batter@@ ed down the doors of the insurance companies , and we actually got TE@@ MP@@ T a machine that let him communicate -- a Stephen Ha@@ w@@ king machine .
Which was a@@ wes@@ ome .
And he &apos;s seriously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est -- I call him Yo@@ da , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; I &apos;m not worthy . This guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
The other thing we did is we fle@@ w seven programm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage , and these h@@ ack@@ ers and programm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists and an@@ arch@@ ists took over our house .
A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stup@@ id to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and gra@@ f on the walls .
But for over two weeks , we programm@@ ed , we went to the Venice bo@@ ard@@ walk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
This is called the E@@ ye@@ Writ@@ er , and you can see the description .
This is a cheap pair of s@@ ung@@ l@@ asses that we bought at the Venice Beach bo@@ ard@@ walk , some copper wire and some stuff from Home De@@ pot and Radio Sh@@ ack .
We took a PS@@ 3 camera , h@@ ack@@ ed it open , mounted it to an LED light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publish the code for free , you download the software for free .
And now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limitations .
There &apos;s no insurance company that can say &quot; No . &quot;
There &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; No . &quot;
Any@@ body who &apos;s par@@ aly@@ zed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
Thank you .
Thank you guys very much . That was a@@ wes@@ ome .
So at the end of the two weeks , we went back to TE@@ MP@@ T &apos;s room .
I love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
So there &apos;s all this hu@@ st@@ le and bust@@ le going on for the big un@@ vei@@ ling .
And after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , car@@ b@@ -@@ fest and all-@@ night sessions , Tony drew again for the first time in seven years .
And this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
We k@@ ic@@ ked his bed so that he could see out .
And we set up a proj@@ ector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital .
And he drew again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was .
The f@@ unny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were leg@@ it in the whole gra@@ f scene too .
So at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; That was the first time I &apos;ve drawn anything for seven years .
I feel like I had been held under@@ water , and someone finally reached down and pul@@ led my head up so I could brea@@ the . &quot;
Is@@ n &apos;t that a@@ wes@@ ome ?
So that &apos;s kind of our battle c@@ ry .
That &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
And we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
This is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an Et@@ ch A Sk@@ etch .
And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more .
So we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stronger .
Since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of acknowled@@ g@@ ment .
We &apos;ve won a b@@ unch of awards .
Remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
It &apos;s all coming out of our own po@@ ckets .
So the awards were like , &quot; O@@ h , this is fantastic . &quot;
Arm@@ strong T@@ wit@@ tered about us , and then in December , Time magazine hon@@ ored us as one of the top 50 inven@@ tions of 2010 , which was really cool .
The cool@@ est thing about this -- and this is what &apos;s completing the whole circle -- is that in April of this year , at the G@@ eff@@ en MO@@ CA in downtown Los Angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called &quot; Art of the Stre@@ ets . &quot;
And &quot; Art of the Stre@@ ets &quot; is going to have pretty much the b@@ ad-@@ asses of the street art scene -- Ban@@ ks@@ y , S@@ he@@ par@@ d F@@ ai@@ rey , K@@ A@@ WS -- all of these guys will be there .
TE@@ MP@@ T &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty a@@ wes@@ ome .
So basically this is my point : If you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
Everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the E@@ ye@@ Writ@@ er -- wasn &apos;t possible at one point .
Make it possible , everyone in this room .
I &apos;m not a programm@@ er , never done anything with oc@@ ular recognition technology , but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? And if not me , then who ?
Thank you guys .
You know , what I do is write for children , and I &apos;m probably America &apos;s most widely read children &apos;s author , in fact .
And I always tell people that I don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scienti@@ st .
You can have me as a far@@ mer , or in le@@ ath@@ ers , and no one has ever chose far@@ mer .
I &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and epi@@ ph@@ anies .
And you know , an epi@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find that you dropped some@@ place .
You &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epi@@ ph@@ any .
That &apos;s a painting of a circle .
A friend of mine did that -- Richard B@@ oll@@ ing@@ broke .
It &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that I &apos;m going to tell you about .
My circle began back in the &apos; 6@@ 0s in high school in St@@ ow , O@@ hi@@ o where I was the class que@@ er .
I was the guy be@@ aten up bloo@@ dy every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers &apos; lounge .
She did it in secret .
She did it for three years .
And I had to get out of town .
I had a thumb , I had 85 dollars , and I ended up in San Francisco , California -- met a lo@@ ver -- and back in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations .
About three or four years ago , I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , Mr@@ s. Posten , who said , &quot; I need to see you .
I &apos;m disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults .
Could you please come to O@@ hi@@ o , and please bring that man that I know you have found by now .
And I should mention that I have pan@@ cre@@ atic cancer , and I &apos;d like you to please be quick about this . &quot;
Well , the next day we were in Cle@@ vel@@ and .
We took a look at her , we lau@@ gh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew that she needed to be in a hosp@@ ice .
We found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and wat@@ ched over her family , because it was necessary .
It &apos;s something we knew how to do .
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of ash@@ es and was placed in my hands .
And what had happened was the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epi@@ ph@@ any I talked about presented itself .
The epi@@ ph@@ any is that death is a part of life .
She saved my life ; I and my partner saved h@@ ers .
And you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
It needs truth and beauty , and I &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
It also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
Thank you .
Imag@@ ine a big explosion as you climb through 3@@ ,000 ft .
Imag@@ ine a plane full of smoke .
Imag@@ ine an engine going cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack .
It sounds sc@@ ary .
Well I had a unique seat that day . I was sitting in 1@@ D .
I was the only one who could talk to the flight attend@@ ants .
So I looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; No problem . We probably hit some birds . &quot;
The pilot had already turned the plane around , and we weren &apos;t that far .
You could see Manhattan .
Two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
The pilot lines up the plane with the Hu@@ dson River .
That &apos;s usually not the route .
He turns off the engines .
Now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
And then he says three words -- the most un@@ emotional three words I &apos;ve ever heard .
He says , &quot; Bra@@ ce for impact . &quot;
I didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight attend@@ ant anymore .
I could see in her eyes , it was terror . Life was over .
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day .
I learned that it all changes in an instant .
We have this bu@@ cket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn &apos;t , all the f@@ ences I wanted to m@@ end , all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did .
As I thought about that later on , I came up with a saying , which is , &quot; I collect bad wines . &quot;
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there , I &apos;m opening it .
I no longer want to postp@@ one anything in life .
And that urgency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge , which was by not a lot -- I thought about , w@@ ow , I really feel one real regret .
I &apos;ve lived a good life .
In my own humanity and mistakes , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried .
But in my humanity , I also allow my ego to get in .
And I reg@@ ret@@ ted the time I wast@@ ed on things that did not matter with people that matter .
And I thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
And after , as I reflected on that , I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life .
It &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
I &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
It feels great .
I no longer try to be right ; I choose to be happy .
The third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
You can see the water coming .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; Please blow up . &quot;
I don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those docum@@ ent@@ aries .
And as we &apos;re coming down , I had a sense of , w@@ ow , dying is not sc@@ ary .
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives .
But it was very sad .
I didn &apos;t want to go ; I love my life .
And that s@@ ad@@ ness really fr@@ amed in one thought , which is , I only wish for one thing .
I only wish I could see my kids grow up .
About a month later , I was at a performance by my daughter -- first-@@ gra@@ der , not much artistic talent ...
... yet .
And I &apos;m ball@@ ing , I &apos;m cr@@ ying , like a little k@@ id .
And it made all the sense in the world to me .
I realized at that point , by connecting those two d@@ ots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
Above all , above all , the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad .
I was given the gift of a mi@@ racle , of not dying that day .
I was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
I challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
What would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ?
How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
And more than anything , are you being the best parent you can ?
Thank you .
The idea behind the Stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is actually quite simple .
We don &apos;t want Iran to get the bomb .
Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the Nat@@ anz ur@@ anium enrich@@ ment facility .
The gra@@ y boxes that you see , these are real-time control systems .
Now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and val@@ ves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
The gra@@ y boxes don &apos;t run Windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a not@@ ebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gra@@ y box , then we are in business .
And this is the plot behind Stu@@ x@@ net .
So we start with a Windows dro@@ pper .
The pay@@ load goes onto the gra@@ y box , damages the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed -- mission accomplished .
That &apos;s easy , hu@@ h ?
I want to tell you how we found that out .
When we started our research on Stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
The only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the Windows part , the dro@@ pper part , used multiple zer@@ o-@@ day vulner@@ abilities .
And it seemed to want to do something with these gra@@ y boxes , these real-time control systems .
So that got our attention , and we started a l@@ ab project where we infected our environment with Stu@@ x@@ net and checked this thing out .
And then some very f@@ unny things happened .
Stu@@ x@@ net beh@@ aved like a l@@ ab rat that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed , but didn &apos;t want to eat .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t make sense to me .
And after we experim@@ ented with different fla@@ vors of cheese , I realized , well , this is a directed attack .
It &apos;s completely directed .
The dro@@ pper is pro@@ w@@ ling actively on the gra@@ y box if a specific configuration is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to inf@@ ect is actually running on that target .
And if not , Stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
So that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because I thought , &quot; Well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
It could be , let &apos;s say for example , a U.S. power plant , or a chemical plant in Germany .
So we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
So we extrac@@ ted and de@@ compiled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s structured in two digital bom@@ bs -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
And we also saw that they are very profession@@ ally engine@@ ered by people who obviously had all insi@@ der information .
They knew all the bits and bit@@ es that they had to attack .
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator .
So they know everything .
And if you have heard that the dro@@ pper of Stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high-tech , let me tell you this : the pay@@ load is ro@@ cket science .
It &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
We are talking about -- around about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
Loo@@ ks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ style assembly language .
And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
So what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
And then we were looking for tim@@ ers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world targets .
So we do need target the@@ ories that we can prove or dis@@ prove .
In order to get target the@@ ories , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hard@@ core sab@@ ot@@ age , it must be a high-@@ value target and it is most likely located in Iran , because that &apos;s where most of the inf@@ ections had been reported .
Now you don &apos;t find several thousand targets in that area .
It basically bo@@ ils down to the Bus@@ h@@ ehr nuclear power plant and to the Nat@@ anz fuel enrich@@ ment plant .
So I told my assi@@ stant , &quot; Get me a list of all cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plant experts from our client base . &quot;
And I ph@@ oned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data .
And that worked pretty well .
So we were able to associ@@ ate the small digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor control .
The ro@@ tor is that moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , that black object that you see .
And if you manip@@ ulate the speed of this ro@@ tor , you are actually able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor and eventually even have the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de .
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers cra@@ zy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
The big digital war@@ head -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
So for example , the number 16@@ 4 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it .
I started to research scientific literature on how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are actually built in Nat@@ anz and found they are structured in what is called a cas@@ c@@ ade , and each cas@@ c@@ ade holds 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
So that made sense , that was a match .
And it even got better .
These cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges in Iran are sub@@ divided into 15 , what is called , stages .
And gu@@ ess what we found in the attack code ?
An almost identical structure .
So again , that was a real good match .
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
These results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor .
And we often went into just a dead end and had to recover .
Any@@ way , so we figur@@ ed out that both digital war@@ heads were actually aiming at one and the same target , but from different ang@@ les .
The small war@@ head is taking one cas@@ c@@ ade , and sp@@ inning up the ro@@ tors and s@@ lowing them down , and the big war@@ head is talking to six cas@@ ca@@ des and manipul@@ ating val@@ ves .
So in all , we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is .
It is Nat@@ anz , and it is only Nat@@ anz .
So we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stu@@ x@@ net .
Here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really kno@@ cked my so@@ cks off .
D@@ own there is the gra@@ y box , and on the top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
Now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the input values from sensors -- so for example , from pressure sensors and vibr@@ ation sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code , which is still running during the attack , with f@@ ake input data .
And as a matter of fact , this f@@ ake input data is actually prer@@ ec@@ ord@@ ed by Stu@@ x@@ net .
So it &apos;s just like from the Hollywood movies where during the hei@@ st , the observation camera is fed with prer@@ ec@@ ord@@ ed video .
That &apos;s cool , hu@@ h ?
The idea here is obviously not only to f@@ ool the operators in the control room .
It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
The idea is to circum@@ vent a digital safety system .
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough .
So for example , in a power plant , when your big steam tur@@ b@@ ine gets too over speed , you must open relief val@@ ves within a milli@@ second .
Obviously , this cannot be done by a human operator .
So this is where we need digital safety systems .
And when they are com@@ promised , then real bad things can happen .
Your plant can blow up .
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it .
That &apos;s sc@@ ary .
But it gets worse .
And this is very important , what I &apos;m going to say .
Th@@ ink about this : this attack is generic .
It doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in specific@@ s , with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , with ur@@ anium enrich@@ ment .
So it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automobile factory .
It is generic .
And you don &apos;t have -- as an attack@@ er -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this pay@@ load by a USB stick , as we saw it in the case of Stu@@ x@@ net .
You could also use conventional wor@@ m technology for spreading .
Just spread it as wide as possible .
And if you do that , what you end up with is a cy@@ ber weapon of mass destruction .
That &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .
So unfortunately , the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East .
They &apos;re in the United States and Europe and in Japan .
So all of the green areas , these are your target@@ -@@ rich environments .
We have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now .
Thanks .
I &apos;ve got a question .
R@@ alp@@ h , it &apos;s been quite widely reported that people assume that Mo@@ ss@@ ad is the main entity behind this .
Is that your opinion ?
R@@ alp@@ h Lan@@ gn@@ er : Ok@@ ay , you really want to hear that ?
Y@@ e@@ ah . Ok@@ ay .
My opinion is that the Mo@@ ss@@ ad is involved , but that the leading force is not Israel .
So the leading force behind that is the cy@@ ber super@@ power .
There is only one , and that &apos;s the United States -- fortunately , fortunately .
Because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
Thank you for scar@@ ing the living day@@ lights out of us . Thank you , R@@ alp@@ h .
I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous .
I went to prison -- difficult .
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
I fil@@ med in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
In fact , most of my career , I &apos;ve been immer@@ sing myself into seem@@ ingly hor@@ ri@@ ble situations for the whole goal of trying to examine soci@@ etal issues in a way that make them eng@@ aging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them enter@@ taining and accessible to an audience .
So when I knew I was coming here to do a T@@ ED Tal@@ k that was going to look at the world of br@@ anding and sponsor@@ ship , I knew I would want to do something a little different .
So as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , I took out an ad on eBay .
I sent out some Facebook messages , some Twitter messages , and I gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights to my 2011 T@@ ED Tal@@ k .
That &apos;s right , some lucky individual , cor@@ poration , for@@ -@@ profit or non-@@ profit , was going to get the on@@ ce-@@ in-@@ a-@@ lifetime opportunity -- because I &apos;m sure Chris Ander@@ son will never let it happen again -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a title , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hin@@ t as to what the subject matter would actually be .
So what you were getting was this : Your name here presents : My T@@ ED Tal@@ k that you have no idea what the subject is and , depending on the content , could ultimately blow up in your face , especially if I make you or your company look stup@@ id for doing it .
But that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
You know how many people watch these T@@ ED Tal@@ ks ?
It &apos;s a lot .
That &apos;s just a working title , by the way .
So even with that c@@ av@@ eat , I knew that someone would buy the nam@@ ing rights .
Now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , I w@@ ouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certainty .
But in the new project that I &apos;m working on , my new film , we examine the world of marketing , advertising .
And as I said earlier , I put myself in some pretty hor@@ ri@@ ble situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
You see , I had this idea for a movie .
Morgan Sp@@ ur@@ lock : What I want to do is make a film all about product placement , marketing and advertising , where the entire film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
So the movie will be called &quot; The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vie E@@ ver S@@ old . &quot;
So what happens in &quot; The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vie E@@ ver S@@ old , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is br@@ anded from beginning to end -- from the abo@@ ve-@@ the-@@ title spons@@ or that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand X@@ .
Now this brand , the Qual@@ com@@ m Stadium , the Sta@@ ples Center ...
these people will be married to the film in perpet@@ u@@ ity -- forever .
And so the film expl@@ ores this whole idea -- It &apos;s what ? In perpet@@ u@@ ity , forever ?
I &apos;m a redundant person .
That was more for emphasis .
It was , &quot; In perpet@@ u@@ ity . For@@ ever . &quot;
But not only are we going to have the brand X title spons@@ or , but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film .
So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wor@@ e ...
the greatest car you ever dro@@ ve from &quot; The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vie E@@ ver S@@ old , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , cour@@ tes@@ y of &quot; The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vie E@@ ver S@@ old . &quot;
X@@ avier Koch@@ h@@ ar : So the idea is , beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life , but actually get them to finance the film ?
MS : And actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
The goal of this whole film is transparency .
You &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
So that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
And I would love for CE@@ G to help make it happen .
Robert Fried@@ man : You know it &apos;s f@@ unny , because when I first hear it , it is the ultimate respect for an audience .
Gu@@ y : I don &apos;t know how recep@@ tive people are going to be to it , though .
X@@ K : Do you have a perspective -- I don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ?
David C@@ ohn : How much money does it take to do this ?
MS : 1.5 million .
John K@@ amen : I think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but I think it &apos;s certainly worth pursuing a couple big , really obvious brands .
X@@ K : Who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a b@@ unch of bli@@ ther@@ ing idi@@ ots .
MS : What do you think the response is going to be ?
Stu@@ art Ru@@ der@@ fer : The responses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
MS : But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
J@@ K : Both .
MS : ... Mean@@ ing not so optimistic .
So , si@@ r , can you help me ? I need help .
M@@ K : I can help you .
MS : Ok@@ ay .
A@@ wes@@ ome .
M@@ K : We &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ta figure out which brands .
MS : Y@@ e@@ ah .
When you look at the people you deal with ..
M@@ K : We &apos;ve got some places we can go .
Tur@@ n the camera off .
MS : I thought &quot; Tur@@ n the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; Let &apos;s have an off-@@ the-@@ record conversation . &quot;
Tur@@ ns out it really means , &quot; We want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
MS : And just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared .
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
I was amaz@@ ed .
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
And I was b@@ lown away , because I thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
Especially in today &apos;s world , this inter@@ section of new media and old media and the fra@@ c@@ tured media landscape , isn &apos;t the idea to get that new bu@@ zz@@ -@@ worthy delivery vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the mass@@ es ?
No , that &apos;s what I thought .
But the problem was , you see , my idea had one fat@@ al f@@ law , and that f@@ law was this .
Ac@@ tually no , that was not the f@@ law whatsoever .
That w@@ ouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
This would have been fine .
But what this image represents was the problem .
See , when you do a Google image search for transparency , this is --@@ - This is one of the first images that comes up .
So I like the way you roll , Ser@@ ge@@ y Br@@ in . No .
This is was the problem : transparency -- free from pre@@ ten@@ se or dec@@ eit ; easily detected or seen through ; readily understood ; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information , especially concerning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
You see , we hear a lot about transparency these days .
Our politicians say it , our president says it , even our CEO &apos;s say it .
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
But why ? Well , transparency is sc@@ ary -- like that od@@ d , still@@ -@@ scre@@ aming bear .
It &apos;s un@@ predictable -- like this od@@ d country road .
And it &apos;s also very ris@@ ky .
What else is ris@@ ky ?
E@@ ating an entire bow@@ l of C@@ ool Whi@@ p .
That &apos;s very ris@@ ky .
Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; No , we want you to tell a story .
We want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
See , when I was a k@@ id and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say , &quot; Son , there &apos;s three sides to every story .
There &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
Now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
But with only one company , one agency willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because I knew John B@@ ond and Richard Kir@@ sh@@ en@@ baum for years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own , I &apos;d have to cut out the mi@@ dd@@ lem@@ an and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
So what you suddenly started to realize -- or what I started to realize -- is that when you started having convers@@ ations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
MS : I have friends who make great big , giant Hollywood films , and I have friends who make little independent films like I make .
And the friends of mine who make big , giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have .
And then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; Well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant Hollywood movies ? &quot;
And the movie is called &quot; The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vie E@@ ver S@@ old . &quot;
So how specifically will we see B@@ an in the film ?
Any time I &apos;m ready to go , any time I open up my medicine cab@@ inet , you will see B@@ an de@@ od@@ or@@ ant .
While any@@ time I do an interview with someone , I can say , &quot; Are you fresh enough for this interview ?
Are you ready ? You look a little ner@@ vous .
I want to help you calm down .
So maybe you should put some one before the interview . &quot;
So we &apos;ll offer one of these fabulous sc@@ ents .
Whether it &apos;s a &quot; Flor@@ al Fusion &quot; or a &quot; Par@@ adise Win@@ ds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
We will have them geared for both male or female -- solid , roll@@ -@@ on or stick , whatever it may be .
That &apos;s the two-@@ cent tour .
So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five-@@ cent tour .
Kar@@ en Frank : We are a smaller brand .
Much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a chall@@ enger brand .
So we don &apos;t have the budgets that other brands have .
So doing things like this -- you know , remind people about B@@ an -- is kind of why were interested in it .
MS : What are the words that you would use to describe B@@ an ?
B@@ an is blan@@ k .
K@@ F : That &apos;s a great question .
W@@ om@@ an : Superior technology .
MS : Technology &apos;s not the way you want to describe something somebody &apos;s putting in their ar@@ mp@@ it .
We talk about bold , fresh .
I think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really sp@@ ins this category into the positive , ver@@ sus &quot; fi@@ ghts od@@ or and w@@ et@@ ness . &quot;
It keeps you fresh .
How do we keep you fres@@ her longer -- better fresh@@ ness , more fresh@@ ness , three times fres@@ her .
Th@@ ings like that that are more of that positive benefit .
MS : And that &apos;s a multi-@@ million dollar cor@@ poration .
What about me ? What about a regular guy ?
I need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular Jo@@ es .
They need to tell me about my brand .
MS : How would you guys describe your brand ?
Um , my brand ?
I don &apos;t know .
I like really nice clothes .
W@@ om@@ an : 80 &apos;s revi@@ val meets sk@@ ater@@ -@@ pun@@ k , unless it &apos;s laundry day .
MS : All right , what is brand Ger@@ ry ?
Ger@@ ry : Uni@@ que .
I gu@@ ess what kind of gen@@ re , style I am would be like dark gl@@ am@@ or .
I like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ ys and stuff like that .
But usually I have an access@@ ory , like s@@ ung@@ l@@ asses , or I like crystal and things like that too .
W@@ om@@ an : If D@@ an were a brand , he might be a classic con@@ verti@@ ble Merc@@ edes B@@ enz .
Man 2 : The brand that I am is , I would call it cas@@ ual fly .
W@@ om@@ an 2 : Part hi@@ pp@@ ie , part yo@@ gi , part Bro@@ o@@ kl@@ yn girl -- I don &apos;t know .
Man 3 : I &apos;m the pet guy .
I sell pet toys all over the country , all over the world .
So I gu@@ ess that &apos;s my brand .
In my war@@ ped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
Man 4 : My brand is F@@ ed@@ E@@ x because I deliver the goods .
Man 5 : F@@ ailed writ@@ er-@@ alcoho@@ lic brand .
Is that something ?
La@@ w@@ yer : I &apos;m a lawyer brand .
Tom : I &apos;m Tom .
MS : Well we can &apos;t all be brand Tom , but I do often find myself at the inter@@ section of dark gl@@ am@@ or and cas@@ ual fly .
And what I realized is I needed an expert .
I needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand personality . &quot;
And so I found a company called Ol@@ son Z@@ alt@@ man in P@@ itt@@ s@@ burg .
They &apos;ve helped companies like N@@ est@@ le , Feb@@ re@@ ze , Hall@@ mark discover that brand personality .
If they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
A@@ big@@ ail : You brought your pictures , right ?
MS : I did . The very first picture is a picture of my family .
A : So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
MS : These are the people who shape the way I look at the world .
A : T@@ ell me about this world .
MS : This world ? I think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the job you do .
All those things st@@ em@@ med and started from one place , and for me they st@@ em@@ med and started with my family in West Vir@@ g@@ inia .
A : What &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
MS : The next one : This was the best day ever .
A : How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
MS : It &apos;s like , who do I want to be ?
I like things that are different .
I like things that are wei@@ rd . I like wei@@ rd things .
A : T@@ ell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
What is the mach@@ ete ? What pup@@ a stage are you in now ?
Why is it important to re@@ boot ? What does the red represent ?
T@@ ell me a little bit about that part .
... A little more about you that is not who you are .
What are some other met@@ amor@@ pho@@ ses that you &apos;ve had ?
... Do@@ esn &apos;t have to be fear . What kind of roll@@ er co@@ aster are you on ?
MS : EE@@ EE@@ E@@ E ! No , thank you .
A : Thanks for you pati@@ ence .
A : Y@@ e@@ ah . All right .
MS : Y@@ e@@ ah , I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
There was a whole lot of cra@@ zy going on in there .
Lin@@ d@@ say Z@@ alt@@ man : The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct , but complementary sides to your brand personality -- the Morgan Sp@@ ur@@ lock brand is a min@@ d@@ ful / play brand .
Those are ju@@ x@@ t@@ apos@@ ed very nicely together .
And I think there &apos;s almost a parad@@ ox with those .
And I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both .
Most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embra@@ ce those , and you actually turn them into positives for you , and it &apos;s a ne@@ at thing to see .
What other brands are like that ?
The first on here is the classic , Apple .
And you can see here too , Tar@@ get , Wi@@ i , Mini from the Mini Co@@ op@@ ers , and J@@ et@@ Blue .
Now there &apos;s play@@ ful brands and min@@ d@@ ful brands , those things that have come and gone , but a play@@ ful , min@@ d@@ ful brand is a pretty powerful thing .
MS : A play@@ ful , min@@ d@@ ful brand . What is your brand ?
If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would you be ?
Are you an up attri@@ bute ? Are you something that gets the blood f@@ lowing ?
Or are you more of a down attri@@ bute ?
Are you something that &apos;s a little more calm , reserved , conservative ?
Up attributes are things like being play@@ ful , being fresh like the Fres@@ h Prince , contemporary , adv@@ entur@@ ous , ed@@ gy or dar@@ ing like Er@@ rol Fl@@ ynn , ni@@ m@@ ble or ag@@ ile , prof@@ ane , dom@@ ine@@ ering , magical or my@@ s@@ tical like G@@ andal@@ f .
Or are you more of a down attri@@ bute ?
Are you min@@ d@@ ful , sophisticated like 00@@ 7 ?
Are you established , traditional , nur@@ turing , protective , emp@@ ath@@ etic like the O@@ pra@@ h ?
Are you reliable , stable , familiar , safe , secure , sac@@ red , contem@@ pl@@ ative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yo@@ da ?
Over the course of this film , we had 500@@ -@@ plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want any part of this project .
They wanted nothing to do with this film , mainly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
But we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to rel@@ inqu@@ ish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as min@@ d@@ ful and as play@@ ful as myself and who ultimately em@@ powered us to tell stories that normally we w@@ ouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an adverti@@ ser would normally never get behind .
They enabled us to tell the story about neur@@ om@@ ark@@ eting , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using M@@ RI &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commerci@@ als as well as movie marketing .
We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising .
In the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no b@@ ill@@ boards , there &apos;s no post@@ ers , there &apos;s no fli@@ ers , nothing .
And we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into c@@ ash@@ -@@ stra@@ pped schools all across America .
What &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that I &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of , or I &apos;ve had the most success in , are ones where I &apos;ve inter@@ acted with things directly .
And that &apos;s what these brands did .
They cut out the mi@@ dd@@ lem@@ an , they cut out their agencies and said , &quot; Maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
I &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
I &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to get people thinking , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world . &quot;
And how has that been for them ? Has it been successful ?
Well , since the film pre@@ m@@ ier@@ ed at the S@@ und@@ ance Film Festival , let &apos;s take a look .
According to Bur@@ r@@ elles , the movie pre@@ m@@ ier@@ ed in January , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 900 million media impres@@ sions for this film .
That &apos;s literally covering just like a two and a half-@@ week period .
That &apos;s only online -- no print , no TV .
The film has@@ n &apos;t even been distributed yet .
It &apos;s not even online . It &apos;s not even stre@@ aming .
It &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
So ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum .
And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part .
What I always believe is that if you take chances , if you take risks , that in those risks will come opportunity .
I believe that when you push people away from that , you &apos;re pushing them more towards failure .
I believe that when you train your employees to be risk a@@ verse , then you &apos;re preparing your whole company to be reward challeng@@ ed .
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks .
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may sc@@ are them .
Ultim@@ ately , moving forward , I think we have to embra@@ ce fear .
We &apos;ve got to put that bear in a c@@ age .
Em@@ bra@@ ce fear . Em@@ bra@@ ce risk .
One big spo@@ on@@ ful at a time , we have to embra@@ ce risk .
And ultimately , we have to embra@@ ce transparency .
Today , more than ever , a little hon@@ esty is going to go a long way .
And that being said , through hon@@ esty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; Em@@ bra@@ ce Transpar@@ ency , &quot; has been brought to you by my good friends at EM@@ C , who for $ 7,@@ 100 bought the nam@@ ing rights on eBay .
EM@@ C : Tur@@ ning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
EM@@ C presents : &quot; Em@@ bra@@ ce Transpar@@ ency . &quot;
Thank you very much , guys .
So , Morgan , in the name of transparency , what exactly happened to that $ 7,@@ 100 ?
MS : That is a fantastic question .
I have in my po@@ cket a check made out to the parent organization to the T@@ ED organization , the Sa@@ pling Foundation -- a check for $ 7,@@ 100 to be applied toward my attend@@ ance for next year &apos;s T@@ ED .
My name is A@@ mit .
And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my bo@@ ss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
And it took 18 months .
A lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
And I grew up in India .
I had a great education -- I &apos;m not compl@@ aining -- but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these art@@ works .
And so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
So , simple : you come to Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Art@@ Pro@@ j@@ ect@@ .com.
You look around at all these museums here .
You &apos;ve got the U@@ ff@@ izi , you &apos;ve got the Mo@@ MA , the Her@@ mit@@ age , the Ri@@ j@@ ks , the Van Go@@ gh .
I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favor@@ ites , the Metro@@ politan Museum of Art in New York .
Two ways of going in -- very simple .
Click and , b@@ ang , you &apos;re in this museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- Bom@@ bay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
You move around , you have fun .
You want to navig@@ ate around the museum ?
Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corrid@@ or .
Keep going . Have fun .
Expl@@ ore .
Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; The Har@@ ves@@ ters &quot; by Pi@@ eter Bru@@ egel at the M@@ et .
I see this plus sign .
If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all of the met@@ a-@@ data information .
For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gi@@ g@@ api@@ xel technology .
So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels .
And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
You can zoom around very simply .
You see some fun stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his expression is pri@@ cel@@ ess .
But then you really want to go deep .
And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
And I was like , &quot; H@@ old on . That sounds interesting . &quot;
W@@ ent in , and I started notic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something .
I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which involves be@@ ating a goo@@ se with a stick on Sh@@ ro@@ ve Tuesday .
And apparently it was quite popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cra@@ cks .
Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
The best is yet to come -- so in a second .
So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the Mo@@ MA , again in New York .
So another one of my favor@@ ites , &quot; The Star@@ ry Night . &quot;
Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
But what if you want to see brush stro@@ kes ?
And what if you want to see how Van Go@@ gh actually created this master@@ piece ?
You zoom in . You really go in .
I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cra@@ cks .
This is &quot; The Star@@ ry Night , &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Coll@@ ections .
Any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a f@@ ancy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images .
Very simply , you go in -- and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Z@@ oom -- you can just zoom around .
This is &quot; The Ambass@@ ad@@ ors , &quot; based in the National Gallery .
You can ann@@ ot@@ ate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these master@@ pieces .
So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
I probably sh@@ ouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these artists .
And that &apos;s been my hum@@ bling experience in this .
I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their art@@ work and represent it properly online .
And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; Did you do this to rep@@ lic@@ ate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
And the answer is no .
It &apos;s to supplement the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is a representation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
There &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive .
And so if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ titude of each h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere , then we can plot our brain .
And for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
This would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive .
So where would you put your brain on this scale ?
Some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these extrem@@ es , but I think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high ap@@ titude in both h@@ emis@@ pher@@ es at the same time .
It &apos;s not like they &apos;re mutually exclusive or anything .
You can be logical and intuitive .
And so I consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental qu@@ ant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
But at the same time , we need a good deal of intu@@ ition to actually make the experiments work .
How do we develop this intu@@ ition ? Well we like to play with stuff .
So we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intu@@ ition from there .
And really you do the same thing .
So some intu@@ ition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
I mean , it can sound wei@@ rd to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
And I remember watching a k@@ id playing on a car stop .
He was just a to@@ dd@@ ler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept falling over .
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
And so this is a great concep@@ tual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist .
It &apos;d be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist , because they don &apos;t play with car stops , they play with these little wei@@ rd partic@@ les .
And when they play with their partic@@ les , they find they do all sorts of really wei@@ rd things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
And so they wrote down all these observations , and they called it the theory of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
And so that &apos;s where physi@@ cs was at a few years ago ; you needed qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe little , tiny partic@@ les .
But you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
This didn &apos;t really sit well with my intu@@ ition , and maybe it &apos;s just because I don &apos;t play with partic@@ les very often .
Well , I play with them sometimes , but not very often .
And I &apos;ve never seen them .
I mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a partic@@ le .
But it didn &apos;t sit well with my logical side either .
Because if everything is made up of little partic@@ les and all the little partic@@ les follow qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics , then sh@@ ouldn &apos;t everything just follow qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
I don &apos;t see any reason why it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t .
And so I &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
So a few years ago , I set off to do just that .
So I made one .
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical qu@@ ant@@ um super@@ position .
So what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
And you can sort of see this green do@@ t right in the middle .
And that &apos;s this piece of metal I &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
This is a phot@@ ograph of the object .
And here I &apos;ll zoom in a little bit . We &apos;re looking right there in the center .
And then here &apos;s a really , really big clo@@ se@@ -up of the little piece of metal .
So what we &apos;re looking at is a little ch@@ unk of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a diving board , and it &apos;s sti@@ cking out over a ledge .
And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
I went into a clean room with a fresh si@@ lic@@ on w@@ af@@ er , and then I just c@@ ran@@ ked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
For the last stuff , I had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming po@@ ol@@ -@@ shaped hole under@@ ne@@ ath the device .
This device has the ability to be in a qu@@ ant@@ um super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it .
Here , let me give you an an@@ alog@@ y .
You know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a crow@@ ded elev@@ ator ?
I mean , when I &apos;m in an elev@@ ator all alone , I do all sorts of wei@@ rd things , but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther them , or , frank@@ ly , sc@@ are them .
So qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that in@@ anim@@ ate objects feel the same way .
The fellow passengers for in@@ anim@@ ate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light sh@@ ining on it and the wind b@@ lowing past it and the heat of the room .
And so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal beh@@ ave qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we &apos;re going to have to k@@ ick out all the other passengers .
And so that &apos;s what we did .
We turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vacuum and su@@ cked out all the air , and then we cool@@ ed it down to just a fra@@ ction of a degree above absolute zero .
Now , all alone in the elev@@ ator , the little ch@@ unk of metal is free to act however it wanted .
And so we measured its motion .
We found it was moving in really wei@@ rd ways .
Instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vibr@@ ating , and the way it was vibr@@ ating was brea@@ thing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bel@@ lows .
And by giving it a gentle nu@@ dge , we were able to make it both vibr@@ ate and not vibr@@ ate at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
So what I &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
What does it mean for one thing to be both vibr@@ ating and not vibr@@ ating at the same time ?
So let &apos;s think about the at@@ oms .
So in one case : all the trilli@@ ons of at@@ oms that make up that ch@@ unk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same at@@ oms are moving up and down .
Now it &apos;s only at precise times when they al@@ ign .
The rest of the time they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized .
That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire ch@@ unk of metal is in two different places .
I think this is really cool .
Re@@ ally .
It was worth lo@@ cking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single atom and that ch@@ unk of metal is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ unk of metal and you .
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that ch@@ unk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
I mean , this is just my logical side talking .
So imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
How would your consciousness handle your body being del@@ oc@@ alized in space ?
There &apos;s one more part to the story .
It &apos;s when we war@@ med it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
And so I had to develop this new intu@@ ition , that it seems like all the objects in the elev@@ ator are really just qu@@ ant@@ um objects just cr@@ amm@@ ed into a tiny space .
You hear a lot of talk about how qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that everything is all inter@@ connected .
Well , that &apos;s not quite right .
It &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
It &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound wei@@ r@@ dness of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
Thank you .
In 2007 , I decided that we needed to re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we thought about economic development .
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a hand@@ ful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents .
Now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
There are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them .
But the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
So we could easily supply the world with doz@@ ens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
Now this might sound pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
But just substitute apartment building for cities .
Imag@@ ine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet .
You could try and expand the capacity by doing addi@@ tions on all the existing apartments .
But you know what you &apos;d run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid dis@@ comfort and the di@@ stra@@ c@@ tions of construction .
So it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those addi@@ tions .
But you could go out some@@ place brand new , build a brand new apartment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facilit@@ ated construction rather than getting in the way .
So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : charter cities .
Later I learned that at about this same time , J@@ avier and Oc@@ ta@@ vio were thinking about the challenge of reform in Hon@@ dur@@ as .
They knew that about 7@@ 5,000 Hon@@ dur@@ ans every year would leave to go to the United States , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in Hon@@ dur@@ as .
At one point , J@@ avier said to Oc@@ ta@@ vio , &quot; What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an emb@@ ass@@ y -- give some to the U.S. emb@@ ass@@ y ; give some to the Canadian emb@@ ass@@ y -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those emb@@ ass@@ y grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do ? &quot;
In the summer of 2009 , Hon@@ dur@@ as went through a w@@ ren@@ ching constitutional crisis .
At the next regularly scheduled election , Pep@@ e Lob@@ o won in a land@@ slide on a platform that promised reform , but reconciliation as well .
He asked Oc@@ ta@@ vio to be his chief of staff .
Meanwhile , I was getting ready to give a talk at T@@ ED@@ Global .
Through a process of re@@ fin@@ ement , trial and error , a lot of user testing , I tried to bo@@ il this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essenti@@ als .
The first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and distur@@ b all the existing apartment holders .
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back .
In the fall of 2010 , a friend from Guatemala sent Oc@@ ta@@ vio a link to the T@@ ED@@ Tal@@ k .
He showed it to J@@ avier .
They called me .
They said , &quot; Let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
So in December we met in Mi@@ ami , in a hotel conference room .
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
And I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City : notice , land that &apos;s worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
But it was a fairly abstra@@ ct discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , Oc@@ ta@@ vio said , &quot; Paul , maybe we could watch the T@@ ED@@ Tal@@ k . &quot;
So the T@@ ED@@ Tal@@ k laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with un@@ inhab@@ ited land , a charter that speci@@ fies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .
So I was asked by the president of Hon@@ dur@@ as who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
I was asked to come to T@@ egu@@ ci@@ g@@ alp@@ a and talk again on January fourth and fifth .
So I presented another fac@@ t-@@ filled lec@@ ture that included a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .
This is a picture of Den@@ ver , and the outline is the new airport that was built in Den@@ ver .
This airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers .
So I was trying to persuade the Hon@@ dur@@ ans , if you build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with a site that &apos;s at least 1,000 square kilometers .
That &apos;s more than 250 hund@@ re@@ d-@@ thousand acres .
Every@@ body appl@@ au@@ ded polit@@ ely .
The faces in the audience were very serious and attentive .
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said , &quot; Professor Rom@@ er , thank you very much for your lec@@ ture , but maybe we could watch the T@@ ED@@ Tal@@ k .
I &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
So I sat down , and they played the T@@ ED@@ Tal@@ k .
And it got to the essence , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
There would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in Hon@@ dur@@ as , instead of hundreds of miles away in the North .
And it also involved new choices for leaders .
Because the leaders in the government there in Hon@@ dur@@ as would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement , so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced .
And the insight of President Lob@@ o was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Hon@@ dur@@ as who had suffered for so many years from fear and di@@ str@@ ust .
We went and looked at a site .
This picture &apos;s from there .
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
And shortly there@@ after , on January 19th , they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions .
In a country which had just gone through this w@@ ren@@ ching crisis , the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 12@@ 4 to one .
All parties , all fac@@ tions in society , backed this .
To be part of the constitution , you actually have to pass it twice in the congress .
On February 17th they passed it again with another vote of 1@@ 14 to one .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after that vote , on February 21st to the 24@@ th , a delegation of about 30 Hon@@ dur@@ ans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
One is South Korea .
This is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in South Korea -- bigger than downtown Boston .
Everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the permits .
The other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is Singapore .
They &apos;ve actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third .
So if you think about this practically , here &apos;s where we are .
They &apos;ve got a site ; they &apos;re already thinking about this site for the second city .
They &apos;re putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in , and also an external legal system .
One country has already volunte@@ ered to let its su@@ preme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there .
There &apos;s designers and buil@@ ders of cities who are very interested .
They even can bring with them some financing .
But the one thing you know they &apos;ve already solved is that there &apos;s lots of ten@@ ants .
There &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americ@@ as , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there .
Around the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who say they &apos;d like to move permanently some@@ place else right now .
There &apos;s a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States .
Many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing .
S@@ adly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get re@@ united with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade .
So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in Hon@@ dur@@ as ?
Or to build a do@@ zen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
What kind of an idea is it to think about insi@@ sting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents ?
This is an idea worth spreading .
And my friends from Hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say thank you , T@@ ED .
