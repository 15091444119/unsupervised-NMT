When I was 11 , I remember w@@ aking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gra@@ y radio .
There was a big s@@ mile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly de@@ pressed him .
&quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
So for the next five years , I dres@@ sed as a boy to esc@@ ort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
It was the only way we both could be educated .
Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
We would cover our books in gro@@ cer@@ y bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
From time to time , the school would suddenly be can@@ cel@@ ed for a week because Taliban were susp@@ icious .
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scar@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ zed and dau@@ gh@@ ters were treas@@ ured .
My grand@@ father was an extraordinary man for his time .
A total ma@@ ver@@ ick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insi@@ sted that his daughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was di@@ sow@@ ned by his father .
But my educated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
She reti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
And my father -- that &apos;s him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his dau@@ gh@@ ters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
To him , there was greater risk in not educ@@ ating his children .
During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustr@@ ated by our life and always being scar@@ ed and not seeing a future .
I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
Your money can be st@@ olen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
Fe@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Mi@@ dd@@ le@@ bury College .
When I returned to Afghanistan , my grand@@ father , the one ex@@ iled from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his dau@@ gh@@ ters , was among the first to congratulate me .
He not only bra@@ gs about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kab@@ ul .
My family believes in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
That &apos;s why I am a global amb@@ ass@@ ador for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global campaign to educ@@ ate women .
That &apos;s why I co@@ founded SOL@@ A , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still ris@@ ky for girls to go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grab@@ bing at opportunity .
And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of da@@ unting opposition .
Like Ah@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ah@@ med is the father of one of my students .
L@@ ess than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SOL@@ A to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a road@@ side bomb by minutes .
As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
&quot; K@@ ill me now , if you wish , &quot; he said , &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and back@@ ward ideas . &quot;
What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recogni@@ zes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their dau@@ gh@@ ters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Under the Taliban , girls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the fragi@@ lity in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; withdrawal .
But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bound@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOL@@ A remind me of that .
Like me , they are dre@@ aming big .
Thank you .
Everything I do , and everything I do profession@@ ally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa .
From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young , but I &apos;m not — -- I worked in Z@@ ambi@@ a , Kenya , I@@ vor@@ y Coast , Algeria , Somalia , in projects of technical cooperation with African countries .
I worked for an Italian NG@@ O , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .
And I was di@@ str@@ au@@ ght .
I thought , age 21 , that we Itali@@ ans were good people and we were doing good work in Africa .
Instead , everything we touched we killed .
Our first project , the one that has inspired my first book , &quot; Ri@@ p@@ ples from the Z@@ am@@ be@@ zi , &quot; was a project where we Itali@@ ans decided to teach Z@@ ambi@@ an people how to grow food .
So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Z@@ ambi@@ a in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Z@@ am@@ be@@ zi River , and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tom@@ at@@ oes and zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini and ...
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .
And we were amaz@@ ed that the local people , in such a fer@@ tile valley , would not have any agriculture .
But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , &quot; Thank God we &apos;re here . &quot;
&quot; Just in the ni@@ ck of time to save the Z@@ ambi@@ an people from star@@ vation . &quot;
And of course , everything in Africa grew beautifully .
We had these magnificent tom@@ at@@ oes . In Italy , a tom@@ ato would grow to this size . In Z@@ ambi@@ a , to this size .
And we could not believe , and we were telling the Z@@ ambi@@ ans , &quot; Look how easy agriculture is . &quot;
When the tom@@ at@@ oes were nice and ri@@ pe and red , overnight , some 200 hi@@ p@@ pos came out from the river and they ate everything .
And we said to the Z@@ ambi@@ ans , &quot; My God , the hi@@ p@@ pos ! &quot;
And the Z@@ ambi@@ ans said , &quot; Yes , that &apos;s why we have no agriculture here . &quot;
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you tell us ? &quot; &quot; You never asked . &quot;
I thought it was only us Itali@@ ans bl@@ undering around Africa , but then I saw what the Americans were doing , what the English were doing , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I became quite proud of our project in Z@@ ambi@@ a .
Because , you see , at least we fed the hi@@ p@@ pos .
You should see the rub@@ b@@ ish — -- You should see the rub@@ b@@ ish that we have best@@ owed on uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting African people .
You want to read the book , read &quot; De@@ ad Aid , &quot; by Dam@@ bis@@ a Mo@@ yo , Z@@ ambi@@ an woman econom@@ ist .
The book was published in 2009 .
We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trilli@@ on American dollars in the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
Just go and read her book .
Read it from an African woman , the damage that we have done .
We Western people are imperi@@ alist , col@@ oni@@ alist mis@@ sion@@ aries , and there are only two ways we deal with people : We either pat@@ ron@@ ize them , or we are pat@@ ern@@ alistic .
The two words come from the Latin root &quot; p@@ ater , &quot; which means &quot; father . &quot;
But they mean two different things .
Pat@@ ern@@ alistic , I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . &quot; I love you so much . &quot;
Pat@@ ron@@ izing , I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants .
That &apos;s why the white people in Africa are called &quot; b@@ w@@ ana , &quot; bo@@ ss .
I was given a sl@@ ap in the face reading a book , &quot; Small is Beautiful , &quot; written by Schu@@ macher , who said , above all in economic development , if people do not wish to be helped , leave them alone .
This should be the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
This morning , the gentlem@@ an who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , &quot; Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not ne@@ ocol@@ onial ? &quot;
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people , and I invented a system called Enterprise Fac@@ ilit@@ ation , where you never initiate anything , you never motiv@@ ate anybody , but you become a serv@@ ant of the local passion , the serv@@ ant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
So what you do -- you shut up .
You never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
We don &apos;t work from offices .
We meet at the caf@@ e . We meet at the pub .
We have zero infrastructure .
And what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give somebody an idea .
If that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , what are you going to do ?
The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
And then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
So years and years ago , I had this idea : Why don &apos;t we , for once , instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do , why don &apos;t , for once , listen to them ? But not in community meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There is a problem with community meetings .
Ent@@ rep@@ rene@@ urs never come , and they never tell you , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity they have identified .
So planning has this blind spot .
The sm@@ art@@ est people in your community you don &apos;t even know , because they don &apos;t come to your public meetings .
What we do , we work one-@@ on-@@ one , and to work one-@@ on-@@ one , you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn &apos;t exist .
You have to create a new profession .
The profession is the family doctor of enterprise , the family doctor of business , who si@@ ts with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at the caf@@ e , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living .
I started this as a tr@@ y@@ out in E@@ sper@@ ance , in Western Australia .
I was a doing a Ph@@ .@@ D. at the time , trying to go away from this pat@@ ron@@ izing bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it that we arrive and tell you what to do .
And so what I did in E@@ sper@@ ance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days I had my first client , and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage , was a Ma@@ ori guy , and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Per@@ th , to get organized , and then the fishermen came to me to say , &quot; You the guy who helped Ma@@ ori ? Can you help us ? &quot;
And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the c@@ ann@@ ery in Alb@@ any for 60 c@@ ents a k@@ il@@ o , but we found a way to take the fish for sus@@ hi to Japan for 15 dollars a k@@ il@@ o , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , &quot; H@@ ey , you helped them . Can you help us ? &quot;
In a year , I had 27 projects going on , and the government came to see me to say , &quot; How can you do that ?
How can you do — ? &quot; And I said , &quot; I do something very , very , very difficult .
I shut up , and listen to them . &quot;
So — — So the government says , &quot; Do it again . &quot;
We &apos;ve done it in 300 communities around the world .
We have helped to start 40@@ ,000 businesses .
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of soli@@ tude .
Peter Drucker , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business , and this is what Peter Drucker says : &quot; Pl@@ anning is actually in@@ compatible with an entrepreneur@@ ial society and economy . &quot;
Pl@@ anning is the k@@ is@@ s of death of entrepreneur@@ ship .
So now you &apos;re re@@ building Christ@@ church without knowing what the sm@@ art@@ est people in Christ@@ church want to do with their own money and their own energy .
You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
You have to offer them confidentiality , privacy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in dro@@ ves .
In a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
Can you imagine a community of 400@@ ,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
Which presentation have you appl@@ au@@ ded the most this morning ?
Local , passion@@ ate people . That &apos;s who you have appl@@ au@@ ded .
So what I &apos;m saying is that entrepreneur@@ ship is where it &apos;s at .
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non@@ renewable fossil fuels , manufacturing -- and all of a sudden , we have systems which are not sustainable .
The internal comb@@ us@@ tion engine is not sustainable .
Fre@@ on way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
What we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educ@@ ate , transport , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
The technologies do not exist to do that .
Who is going to inv@@ ent the technology for the green revolution ? Universi@@ ties ? For@@ get about it !
Government ? For@@ get about it !
It will be entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re doing it now .
There &apos;s a lovely story that I read in a futur@@ ist magazine many , many years ago .
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 18@@ 60 .
And in 18@@ 60 , this group of people came together , and they all spec@@ ulated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years , and the conclusion was unanimous : The city of New York would not exist in 100 years .
Why ? Because they looked at the cur@@ ve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million horses , and the man@@ ure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .
They were already dro@@ w@@ ning in man@@ ure .
So 18@@ 60 , they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to cho@@ ke the life out of New York .
So what happens ? In 40 years &apos; time , in the year 1900 , in the United States of America , there were 1,@@ 001 car manufacturing companies -- 1,@@ 001 .
The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little factories in back@@ waters .
D@@ ear@@ born , Mich@@ ig@@ an . Henry Ford .
However , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First , you have to offer them confidentiality .
Otherwise they don &apos;t come and talk to you .
Then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passion@@ ate service to them .
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneur@@ ship .
The smallest company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beautifully : The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
Gu@@ ess what ?
We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
It doesn &apos;t exist .
This person has never been born .
We &apos;ve done the research , and we have looked at the 100 i@@ con@@ ic companies of the world -- Car@@ neg@@ ie , West@@ in@@ gh@@ ouse , E@@ dis@@ on , Ford , all the new companies , Google , Yahoo .
There &apos;s only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : None were started by one person .
Now we teach entrepreneur@@ ship to 16-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds in Nor@@ thum@@ ber@@ land , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Bran@@ son &apos;s auto@@ bi@@ ography , and the task of the 16-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds is to underline , in the first two pages of Richard Bran@@ son &apos;s auto@@ bi@@ ography how many times Richard uses the word &quot; I &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; we . &quot;
N@@ ever the word &quot; I , &quot; and the word &quot; we &quot; 32 times .
He wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
Nob@@ ody started a company alone . No one .
So we can create the community where we have facilit@@ ators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated bud@@ dies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentlem@@ an who talks about this ep@@ ic , somebody who will say to you , &quot; What do you need ?
What can you do ? Can you make it ?
Ok@@ ay , can you sell it ? Can you look after the money ? &quot;
&quot; O@@ h , no , I cannot do this . &quot; &quot; Would you like me to find you somebody ? &quot;
We activate communities .
We have groups of volunte@@ ers supporting the Enterprise Fac@@ ilit@@ ator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the mi@@ racle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by cap@@ turing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Ali@@ ce in W@@ onder@@ land .
P@@ enn State asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students .
And I was scar@@ ed .
Re@@ ally scar@@ ed . S@@ car@@ ed of these students with their big bra@@ ins and their big books and their big , un@@ familiar words .
But as these convers@@ ations un@@ fol@@ ded , I experienced what Ali@@ ce must have when she went down that rab@@ bit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
That &apos;s just how I felt as I had those convers@@ ations with the students . I was amaz@@ ed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonder@@ land as well .
And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
We desper@@ ately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grand@@ est challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non-@@ scientists to have these inter@@ actions .
But these great convers@@ ations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
So scientists and engineers , please , talk ner@@ dy to us .
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is eng@@ aging .
First question to answer for us : so what ?
T@@ ell us why your science is relevant to us .
Don &apos;t just tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , but tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , which is the mes@@ h-@@ like structure of our b@@ ones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis .
And when you &apos;re descri@@ bing your science , bew@@ are of jar@@ gon .
Jar@@ gon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
S@@ ure , you can say &quot; spati@@ al and tempor@@ al , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as du@@ mb@@ ing it down .
Instead , as Ein@@ stein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
You can clearly communicate your science without com@@ promising the ideas .
A few things to consider are having examples , stories and an@@ alo@@ gi@@ es . Those are ways to engage and exc@@ ite us about your content .
And when presenting your work , drop the bul@@ let points .
Have you ever wonder@@ ed why they &apos;re called bul@@ let points ?
What do bul@@ lets do ? Bul@@ lets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
A slide like this is not only bor@@ ing , but it rel@@ ies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhel@@ med .
Instead , this example slide by Gen@@ e@@ vie@@ ve Brown is much more effective . It &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower .
And the tri@@ ck here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visu@@ als which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engineering .
And because the engineers that I &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner ner@@ d , I want to summ@@ ari@@ ze with an equ@@ ation .
Take your science , sub@@ trac@@ t your bul@@ let points and your jar@@ gon , divide by relevance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multip@@ ly it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible inter@@ actions that are full of understanding .
And so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved this equ@@ ation , by all means , talk ner@@ dy to me .
Thank you .
H@@ i . This is my mobile phone .
A mobile phone can change your life , and gives you individual freedom .
With a mobile phone , you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria .
With a mobile phone , you can t@@ we@@ et a message and start a protest in Egypt .
And with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to Sound@@ Cl@@ oud and become famous .
All this is possible with your mobile phone .
I &apos;m a child of 1984 , and I live in the city of Berlin .
Let &apos;s go back to that time , to this city .
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and prot@@ ested for change .
This is autumn 1989 , and imagine that all those people standing up and prot@@ esting for change had a mobile phone in their po@@ cket .
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
H@@ old it up .
H@@ old your phones up , hold your phones up !
H@@ old it up . An Andro@@ id , a Black@@ berry , w@@ ow .
That &apos;s a lot . Almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
And I will talk about this .
These are 3@@ 5,@@ 8@@ 30 lines of information .
Ra@@ w data .
And why are these informations there ?
Because in the summer of 2006 , the E.@@ U@@ . Commission tabled a directive .
This directive &#91; is &#93; called Data Ret@@ ention Directive .
This directive says that each phone company in Europe , each Internet service company all over Europe , has to store a wide range of information about the users .
Who calls whom ? Who sends whom an email ?
Who sends whom a text message ?
And if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
All this information is stored for at least six months , up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provider .
And all over Europe , people stood up and said , &quot; We don &apos;t want this . &quot;
They said , we don &apos;t want this data retention .
We want self-@@ determination in the digital age , and we don &apos;t want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us .
They were lawyers , journalists , pri@@ ests , they all said : &quot; We don &apos;t want this . &quot;
And here you can see , like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of Berlin and said , &quot; Freedom , not fear . &quot;
And some even said , this would be St@@ asi 2.0 .
St@@ asi was the secret police in East Germany .
And I also ask myself , does it really work ?
Can they really store all this information about us ?
Every time I use my mobile phone ?
So I asked my phone company , Deutsche Telek@@ om , which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany , and I asked them , please , send me all the information you have stored about me .
And I asked them once , and I asked them again , and I got no real answer . It was only bl@@ ah bl@@ ah answers .
But then I said , I want to have this information , because this is my life you are proto@@ col@@ ing .
So I decided to start a law@@ suit against them , because I wanted to have this information .
But Deutsche Telek@@ om said , no , we will not give you this information .
So at the end , I had a settlement with them .
I &apos;ll put down the law@@ suit and they will send me all the information I ask for .
Because in the mean time , the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.@@ U@@ . directive into German law was un@@ constitutional .
So I got this ug@@ ly brown en@@ velop@@ e with a C.@@ D. inside .
And on the C.@@ D. , this was on .
Thir@@ ty-@@ five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information .
At first I saw it , and I said , ok@@ ay , it &apos;s a huge file . Ok@@ ay .
But then after a while I realized , this is my life .
This is six months of my life , into this file .
So I was a little bit skep@@ tical , what should I do with it ?
Because you can see where I am , where I sleep at night , what I am doing .
But then I said , I want to go out with this information .
I want to make them public .
Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean .
So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City , I did this .
This is a visu@@ alization of six months of my life .
You can zoom in and zoom out , you can wind back and fast forward .
You can see every step I take .
And you can even see how I go from Frankfurt by train to Cologne , and how often I call in between .
All this is possible with this information .
That &apos;s a little bit sc@@ ary .
But it is not only about me .
It &apos;s about all of us .
First , it &apos;s only like , I call my wife and she calls me , and we talk to each other a couple of times .
And then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other .
And after a while you are calling you , and you are calling you , and you have this great communication network .
But you can see how your people are communic@@ ating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
You can see all of this .
You can see the h@@ ub@@ s , like who are the leaders in the group .
If you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
If you have access to this information , you can control your society .
This is a blu@@ ep@@ rin@@ t for countries like China and Iran .
This is a blu@@ ep@@ rin@@ t how to survey your society , because you know who talks to whom , who sends whom an email , all this is possible if you have access to this information .
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe , up to two years .
Like I said at the beginning , imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin in autumn of 1989 had a mobile phone in their po@@ cket .
And the St@@ asi would have known who took part at this protest , and if the St@@ asi would have known who are the leaders behind it , this may never have happened .
The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not &#91; have been &#93; there .
And in the after@@ math , also not the fall of the Ir@@ on Cur@@ tain .
Because today , state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and offline .
They want to have the possibility to track our lives , and they want to store them for all time .
But self-@@ determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction .
But you have to fight for your self-@@ determination today .
You have to fight for it every day .
So , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and it &apos;s not out@@ dated .
When you go home , tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information , they don &apos;t have to do it .
And if you don &apos;t believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .
So , in the future , every time you use your mobile phone , let it be a remin@@ der to you that you have to fight for self-@@ determination in the digital age .
Thank you .
I live in South Central .
This is South Central : liqu@@ or stores , fast food , vac@@ ant lots .
So the city plann@@ ers , they get together and they figure they &apos;re going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else , so they change it to South Los Angeles , like this is going to fix what &apos;s really going wrong in the city .
This is South Los Angeles .
Li@@ qu@@ or stores , fast food , vac@@ ant lots .
Just like 2@@ 6.@@ 5 million other Americans , I live in a food desert , South Central Los Angeles , home of the dri@@ ve-@@ th@@ ru and the dri@@ ve-@@ by .
F@@ unny thing is , the dri@@ ve-@@ th@@ rus are killing more people than the dri@@ ve-@@ b@@ ys .
People are dying from cur@@ able diseases in South Central Los Angeles .
For instance , the o@@ bes@@ ity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , Be@@ ver@@ ly H@@ ills , which is probably eight , 10 miles away .
I got tired of seeing this happening .
And I was wonder@@ ing , how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food , if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood ?
I see whe@@ el@@ chairs bought and sold like used cars .
I see di@@ aly@@ sis centers p@@ opping up like Star@@ bu@@ cks .
And I figur@@ ed , this has to stop .
So I figur@@ ed that the problem is the solution .
Food is the problem and food is the solution .
Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an app@@ le that wasn &apos;t im@@ pregn@@ ated with pesticides .
So what I did , I plan@@ ted a food forest in front of my house .
It was on a strip of land that we call a park@@ way .
It &apos;s 150 feet by 10 feet .
Th@@ ing is , it &apos;s owned by the city .
But you have to maintain it .
So I &apos;m like , &quot; C@@ ool . I can do whatever the hell I want , since it &apos;s my responsibility and I g@@ ot@@ ta maintain it . &quot;
And this is how I decided to maintain it .
So me and my group , L@@ .@@ A. Green Gro@@ unds , we got together and we started pl@@ anting my food forest , fruit trees , you know , the whole nine , vegetables .
What we do , we &apos;re a pay@@ -@@ it-@@ forward kind of group , where it &apos;s composed of gar@@ den@@ ers from all walks of life , from all over the city , and it &apos;s completely volunte@@ er , and everything we do is free .
And the garden , it was beautiful .
And then somebody compl@@ ained .
The city came down on me , and basically gave me a c@@ itation saying that I had to remove my garden , which this c@@ itation was turning into a warrant .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; Come on , really ?
A warrant for pl@@ anting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? &quot;
And I was like , &quot; C@@ ool . Br@@ ing it . &quot;
Because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .
So L@@ .@@ A. Times got ah@@ old of it . Steve L@@ op@@ ez did a story on it and talked to the coun@@ c@@ il@@ man , and one of the Green Gro@@ unds members , they put up a petition on Ch@@ ange@@ .org , and with 900 signatures , we were a success .
We had a victory on our hands .
My coun@@ c@@ il@@ man even called in and said how they endorse and love what we &apos;re doing .
I mean , come on , why w@@ ouldn &apos;t they ?
L@@ .@@ A. leads the United States in vac@@ ant lots that the city actually owns .
They own 26 square miles of vac@@ ant lots .
That &apos;s 20 Central Parks .
That &apos;s enough space to plant 7@@ 25 million tom@@ ato plants .
Why in the hell would they not ok@@ ay this ?
Gro@@ wing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
When one dollar &apos;s worth of green be@@ ans will give you 75 dollars &apos; worth of produce .
It &apos;s my go@@ sp@@ el , when I &apos;m telling people , grow your own food .
Gro@@ wing your own food is like printing your own money .
See , I have a legacy in South Central .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people , and I &apos;m manufacturing my own reality .
See , I &apos;m an artist .
Gar@@ dening is my gra@@ ff@@ iti . I grow my art .
Just like a gra@@ ff@@ iti artist , where they beauti@@ fy walls , me , I beautiful law@@ ns , park@@ ways .
I use the garden , the soil , like it &apos;s a piece of clo@@ th , and the plants and the trees , that &apos;s my em@@ bel@@ lish@@ ment for that clo@@ th .
You &apos;d be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your can@@ vas .
You just couldn &apos;t imagine how amazing a sun@@ flower is and how it affects people .
So what happened ?
I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education , a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood .
To change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
We are the soil .
You &apos;d be surprised how kids are affected by this .
Gar@@ dening is the most therapeutic and de@@ fi@@ ant act you can do , especially in the inner city .
Plus you get stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries .
I remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , 10 : 30 at night , and they were in my yard , and I came out and they looked so ash@@ amed .
So I &apos;m like , man , it made me feel bad that they were there , and I told them , you know , you don &apos;t have to do this like this .
This is on the street for a reason .
It made me feel ash@@ amed to see people that were this close to me that were hung@@ ry , and this only reinforced why I do this , and people asked me , &quot; F@@ in , aren &apos;t you afraid people are going to ste@@ al your food ? &quot;
And I &apos;m like , &quot; H@@ ell no , I ain &apos;t afraid they &apos;re g@@ onna ste@@ al it .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
That &apos;s the whole idea .
I want them to take it , but at the same time , I want them to take back their health . &quot;
There &apos;s another time when I put a garden in this hom@@ eless shel@@ ter in downtown Los Angeles .
These are the guys , they helped me un@@ load the truck .
It was cool , and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grand@@ mother , and it was just cool to see how this changed them , if it was only for that one moment .
So Green Gro@@ unds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens .
We &apos;ve had , like , 50 people come to our dig@@ -@@ ins and participate , and it &apos;s all volunte@@ ers .
If kids grow k@@ ale , kids eat k@@ ale .
If they grow tom@@ at@@ oes , they eat tom@@ at@@ oes .
But when none of this is presented to them , if they &apos;re not shown how food affects the mind and the body , they blin@@ dly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them .
I see young people and they want to work , but they &apos;re in this thing where they &apos;re caught up -- I see kids of color and they &apos;re just on this track that &apos;s designed for them , that leads them to no@@ where .
So with gar@@ dening , I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
And when we do this , who knows ?
We might produce the next George Washington Car@@ ver .
but if we don &apos;t change the composition of the soil , we will never do this .
Now this is one of my plans . This is what I want to do .
I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block .
I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not talking about no free sh@@ it , because free is not sustainable .
The f@@ unny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it .
What I &apos;m talking about is putting people to work , and getting kids off the street , and letting them know the joy , the pride and the honor in growing your own food , opening far@@ mer &apos;s markets .
So what I want to do here , we g@@ ot@@ ta make this sexy .
So I want us all to become ec@@ ol@@ u@@ tionary ren@@ eg@@ ades , gang@@ st@@ as , gang@@ sta gar@@ den@@ ers .
We g@@ ot@@ ta fli@@ p the script on what a gang@@ sta is .
If you ain &apos;t a gar@@ den@@ er , you ain &apos;t gang@@ sta .
Get gang@@ sta with your sho@@ vel , ok@@ ay ?
And let that be your weapon of choice .
So basically , if you want to meet with me , you know , if you want to meet , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit around in c@@ ush@@ y chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some sh@@ it -- where you talk about doing some sh@@ it .
If you want to meet with me , come to the garden with your sho@@ vel so we can plant some sh@@ it .
Peace . Thank you .
Thank you .
One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dic@@ tionary is &quot; sn@@ oll@@ y@@ go@@ ster . &quot;
Just because it sounds so good .
And what sn@@ oll@@ y@@ go@@ ster means is &quot; a dish@@ on@@ est politi@@ cian . &quot;
Although there was a 19@@ th-@@ century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said , &quot; A sn@@ oll@@ y@@ go@@ ster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party , platform or principle , and who , when he wins , gets there by the she@@ er force of monum@@ ental tal@@ kn@@ ophi@@ cal assum@@ n@@ ancy . &quot;
Now I have no idea what &quot; tal@@ kn@@ ophi@@ cal &quot; is .
Some@@ thing to do with words , I assume .
But it &apos;s very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language .
It wasn &apos;t until , for example , 17@@ 71 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber .
And this was actually all down to the bra@@ very of a guy with the extraordinary name of Br@@ ass Cro@@ s@@ by , who took on Parliament .
And he was thrown into the Tower of London and impris@@ oned , but he was bra@@ ve enough , he was bra@@ ve enough to take them on , and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won .
And it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase &quot; as bold as br@@ ass . &quot;
Most people think that &apos;s down to the metal .
It &apos;s not . It &apos;s down to a campaign@@ er for the freedom of the press .
But to really show you how words and politics inter@@ act , I want to take you back to the United States of America , just after they &apos;d achieved independence .
And they had to face the question of what to call George Washington , their leader .
They didn &apos;t know .
What do you call the leader of a re@@ public@@ an country ?
And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages .
And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table , which might have made it .
I mean , some people wanted him to be called Chief Mag@@ i@@ str@@ ate Washington , and other people , His High@@ ness George Washington , and other people , Prot@@ ector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington .
Not that cat@@ chy .
Some people just wanted to call him King .
They thought it was tried and tested .
And they weren &apos;t even being mon@@ arch@@ ical there , they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term .
And , you know , it could have worked .
And everybody got ins@@ an@@ ely bor@@ ed , actually , because this debate went on for three weeks .
I read a di@@ ary of this poor sen@@ ator , who just keeps coming back , &quot; Still on this subject . &quot;
And the reason for the delay and the bor@@ ed@@ om was that the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives were against the Sen@@ ate .
The House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives didn &apos;t want Washington to get dr@@ unk on power .
They didn &apos;t want to call him King in case that gave him ideas , or his successor ideas .
So they wanted to give him the hum@@ bl@@ est , me@@ ag@@ er@@ est , most pa@@ thetic title that they could think of .
And that title was &quot; President . &quot;
President . They didn &apos;t inv@@ ent the title . I mean , it existed before , but it just meant somebody who presi@@ des over a meeting .
It was like the for@@ em@@ an of the jury .
And it didn &apos;t have much more gran@@ de@@ ur than the term &quot; for@@ em@@ an &quot; or &quot; over@@ se@@ er . &quot;
There were occa@@ sional pres@@ idents of little colonial coun@@ cils and bits of government , but it was really a nothing title .
And that &apos;s why the Sen@@ ate obj@@ ected to it .
They said , that &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , you can &apos;t call him President .
This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dign@@ it@@ aries .
And who &apos;s going to take him seriously if he &apos;s got a sil@@ ly little title like President of the United States of America ?
And after three weeks of debate , in the end the Sen@@ ate did not cave in .
Instead , they agreed to use the title &quot; President &quot; for now , but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn &apos;t agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civili@@ zed nations , whether under re@@ public@@ an or mon@@ arch@@ ical forms of government , whose custom it is to ann@@ ex , through the office of the Chief Mag@@ i@@ str@@ ate , titles of resp@@ ect@@ ability -- not bloo@@ dy President -- and that in the inter@@ course with foreign nations , the maj@@ esty of the people of the United States may not be haz@@ ar@@ ded by an appearance of sing@@ ul@@ arity , i.e. , we don &apos;t want to look like bloo@@ dy wei@@ r@@ dos .
Now you can learn three interesting things from this .
First of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the Sen@@ ate has never formally endorsed the title of President .
Barack Obama , President Obama , is there on bor@@ row@@ ed time , just waiting for the Sen@@ ate to spring into action .
Second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later .
But the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that hum@@ ble at all these days , does it ?
Some@@ thing to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of d@@ ron@@ es and all that sort of stuff .
Re@@ ality and history have end@@ owed that title with gran@@ de@@ ur .
And so the Sen@@ ate won in the end .
They got their title of resp@@ ect@@ ability .
And also , the Sen@@ ate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of sing@@ ul@@ arity -- well , it was a sing@@ ul@@ arity back then .
But now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
A hundred and fort@@ y-@@ seven .
All because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
And so , in the end , the Sen@@ ate won and the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that hum@@ ble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
And that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Poli@@ ti@@ cians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Thank you very much .
So I arrived by truck with about 50 re@@ bels to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ ab@@ ad as a 19@@ -@@ year-old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .
I tra@@ ded my Con@@ verse black low-@@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a ro@@ cket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .
And this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ e@@ po@@ vers and Saturday so@@ cc@@ er games and fi@@ st@@ fi@@ ghts with rac@@ ist children of the Con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o-@@ nation@@ alist demonstrations ch@@ anting , &quot; D@@ own with commun@@ ism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ i@@ gi@@ es of Bre@@ zh@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
But this is the ge@@ ography of self .
And so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an ath@@ ei@@ st and a radic@@ ally politi@@ ci@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ b@@ ows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and re@@ interpre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imagin@@ ative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who we@@ ars his ji@@ had against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious intim@@ id@@ ation and political corruption to make himself rich .
And where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the s@@ logan : &quot; Vo@@ te for me ! I &apos;ve done ji@@ had , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
And try and use this campaign to ex@@ pose these ma@@ fi@@ o@@ sos who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national her@@ oes .
I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; Pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a f@@ ake check@@ point on the street of Kab@@ ul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bri@@ be , offering them money and ap@@ ologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kab@@ ul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
The war and the exp@@ atri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bom@@ bers where I take local Afghan fox fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jack@@ et or make multiple interior po@@ ckets on fashionable neo-@@ traditional v@@ ests .
And I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kab@@ ul whe@@ el@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall am@@ id@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colonial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
But doing these things , they can get you in j@@ ail , they can be mis@@ understood , mis@@ interpreted .
But I do them because I have to , because the ge@@ ography of self mand@@ ates it .
That is my burden . What &apos;s yours ?
Thank you .
H@@ i . My name is Cam@@ eron Rus@@ sell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
Ac@@ tually , for 10 years .
And I feel like there &apos;s an un@@ comfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
So lu@@ ck@@ ily I brought an out@@ fit change .
This is the first out@@ fit change on the T@@ ED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
If some of the women were really hor@@ ri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Not everybody gets to do that .
These he@@ els are very un@@ comfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
The worst part is putting this swe@@ ater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all lau@@ gh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
All right .
So why did I do that ?
That was aw@@ k@@ ward .
Well , hopefully not as aw@@ k@@ ward as that picture .
Image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
And in this picture , I had actually never had a boy@@ friend in real life .
I was totally un@@ comfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
And of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the f@@ ake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ utable , has a huge impact on our lives .
So today , for me , being fear@@ less means being honest .
And I am on this stage because I am a model .
I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
And I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest tw@@ ist .
So the first question is , how do you become a model ?
And I always just say , &quot; O@@ h , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lot@@ tery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wonder@@ ing what is a legacy .
Well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and sy@@ mm@@ etry that we &apos;re bi@@ ologically programm@@ ed to admire , but also as t@@ all , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ inity and white skin .
And this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been c@@ ash@@ ing out on .
And I know there are people in the audience who are skep@@ tical at this point , and maybe there are some fashi@@ on@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wa@@ it . Na@@ om@@ i . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an Sm@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
And first , I commend you on your model knowledge . Very impressive .
But unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired N@@ Y@@ U Ph@@ .@@ D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hi@@ red , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hi@@ red , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non-@@ white .
The next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
And the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
But the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
You know ? You can be anything .
You could be the President of the United States , or the invent@@ or of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja car@@ di@@ o-@@ thor@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ ge@@ on po@@ et , which would be a@@ wes@@ ome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
If , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cam@@ eron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my bo@@ ss . &quot;
Because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next St@@ even Mei@@ sel .
S@@ aying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
It &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s a@@ wes@@ ome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike car@@ di@@ o-@@ thor@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ ge@@ ons , it can just be di@@ still@@ ed right into -- right now .
So if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cam@@ eron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imag@@ inary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
It will look something like this .
Hop@@ efully less aw@@ k@@ ward than that one in the middle .
That was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Unfortunately after you &apos;ve gone to school , and you have a ré@@ sum@@ é and you &apos;ve done a few jobs , you can &apos;t say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the President of the United States , but your ré@@ sum@@ é reads , &quot; Under@@ wear Model : 10 years , &quot; people give you a f@@ unny look .
The next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
And ye@@ ah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
This picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had worn a bi@@ k@@ ini , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
I know we &apos;re getting personal , but I was a young girl .
This is what I looked like with my grand@@ ma just a few months earlier .
Here &apos;s me on the same day as this shoot .
My friend got to come with me .
Here &apos;s me at a sl@@ um@@ ber party a few days before I shot French Vo@@ gue .
Here &apos;s me on the so@@ cc@@ er team and in V Magazine .
And here &apos;s me today .
And I hope what you &apos;re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
They are construc@@ tions , and they are construc@@ tions by a group of professionals , by hair@@ sty@@ lists and ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p artists and photograph@@ ers and sty@@ lists and all of their assist@@ ants and pre-@@ production and post-@@ production , and they build this . That &apos;s not me .
Ok@@ ay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
I do have too many 8-@@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I for@@ got my money and they gave me the dress for free .
When I was a teen@@ ager , I was driving with my friend who was an aw@@ ful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pul@@ led over , and all it took was a &quot; Sor@@ ry , officer , &quot; and we were on our way .
And I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
I live in New York , and last year , of the 14@@ 0@@ ,000 teen@@ agers that were stopped and fris@@ ked , 86 percent of them were black and Lat@@ ino , and most of them were young men .
And there are only 17@@ 7@@ ,000 young black and Lat@@ ino men in New York , so for them , it &apos;s not a question of , &quot; Will I get stopped ? &quot;
but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? When will I get stopped ? &quot;
When I was resear@@ ching this talk , I found out that of the 13@@ -@@ year-old girls in the United States , 53 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
So the last question people ask me is , &quot; What is it like to be a model ? &quot;
And I think the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; If you are a little bit sk@@ in@@ nier and you have sh@@ ini@@ er hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . &quot;
And when we &apos;re back@@ stage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
We say , &quot; It &apos;s really amazing to travel , and it &apos;s amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passion@@ ate people . &quot;
And those things are true , but they &apos;re only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that I have never said on camera , is , &quot; I am in@@ secure . &quot;
And I &apos;m in@@ secure because I have to think about what I look like every day .
And if you ever are wonder@@ ing , &quot; If I have th@@ inner thi@@ ghs and sh@@ ini@@ er hair , will I be happ@@ ier ? &quot;
you just need to meet a group of models , because they have the th@@ inn@@ est thi@@ ghs and the sh@@ ini@@ est hair and the cool@@ est clothes , and they &apos;re the most physi@@ cally in@@ secure women probably on the planet .
So when I was writing this talk , I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , I felt very un@@ comfortable to come out here and say , &quot; Look I &apos;ve received all these benefits from a deck st@@ ack@@ ed in my favor , &quot; and it also felt really un@@ comfortable to follow that up with , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t always make me happy . &quot;
But mostly it was difficult to un@@ pack a legacy of gender and ra@@ cial op@@ pression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries .
But I &apos;m also happy and hon@@ ored to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then I w@@ ouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I w@@ ouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
If there &apos;s a tak@@ e@@ away to this talk , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowled@@ ging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .
Thank you .
I have never , ever forgotten the words of my grand@@ mother who died in her ex@@ ile : &quot; Son , resist G@@ add@@ af@@ i . Fi@@ ght him .
But don &apos;t you ever turn into a G@@ add@@ af@@ i-@@ like revolutionary . &quot;
Almost two years have passed since the Liby@@ an Revolution broke out , inspired by the waves of mass mobili@@ zation in both the Tunisi@@ an and the Egyptian revol@@ utions .
I joined forces with many other Liby@@ ans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ cal regime of G@@ add@@ af@@ i .
And there it was , a great revolution .
Young Liby@@ an women and men were at the for@@ efront calling for the fall of the regime , raising slo@@ gan@@ s of freedom , dignity , social justice .
They have shown an exemplary bra@@ very in confron@@ ting the brutal dictatorship of G@@ add@@ af@@ i .
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south .
Event@@ ually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50@@ ,000 dead , we managed to liber@@ ate our country and to t@@ opp@@ le the ty@@ rant .
However , G@@ add@@ af@@ i left behind a heavy burden , a legacy of ty@@ ran@@ ny , corruption and seeds of di@@ versions .
For four decades G@@ add@@ af@@ i &apos;s ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ cal regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Liby@@ an society .
A@@ ware of the dev@@ ast@@ ation and the challenges , I was keen among many other women to re@@ build the Liby@@ an civil society , calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation .
Almost 200 organizations were established in B@@ eng@@ ha@@ zi during and immediately after the fall of G@@ add@@ af@@ i -- almost 300 in Tri@@ poli .
After a period of 33 years in ex@@ ile , I went back to Libya , and with unique enthusiasm , I started organizing workshops on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
With an amazing group of women , I co-@@ founded the Liby@@ an Women &apos;s Platform for Peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the soci@@ opoli@@ tical em@@ power@@ ment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-@@ elections , an environment which was increasingly pol@@ ari@@ zed , an environment which was shaped by the sel@@ fish politics of domin@@ ance and exclusion .
I led an initiative by the Liby@@ an Women &apos;s Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law , a law that would give every citizen , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to sti@@ p@@ ulate on political parties the altern@@ ation of male and female candidates ver@@ tically and horizont@@ ally in their lists , creating the zi@@ pper list .
Event@@ ually , our initiative was adopted and successful .
Women won 17.@@ 5 percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in 52 years .
However , bit by bit , the eu@@ ph@@ oria of the elections , and of the revolution as a whole , was f@@ ading out -- for every day we were w@@ aking up to the news of violence .
One day we wake up to the news of the des@@ ec@@ r@@ ation of ancient mos@@ ques and Su@@ fi tom@@ bs .
On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American amb@@ ass@@ ador and the attack on the cons@@ ulate .
On another day we wake up to the news of the assass@@ ination of army officers .
And every day , every day we wake up with the rule of the mili@@ ti@@ as and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their dis@@ respect of the rule of law .
Our society , shaped by a revolutionary min@@ d@@ set , became more pol@@ ari@@ zed and has driven away from the ide@@ als and the principles -- freedom , dignity , social justice -- that we first held .
Int@@ oler@@ ance , exclusion and re@@ ven@@ ge became the icons of the &#91; after@@ math &#93; of the revolution .
I am here today not at all to insp@@ ire you with our success story of the zi@@ pper list and the elections .
I &apos;m rather here today to conf@@ ess that we as a nation took the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
We did not priori@@ ti@@ ze right .
For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya .
Did the zi@@ pper list and the altern@@ ation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation ?
No , it didn &apos;t .
What is it , then ?
Why does our society continue to be pol@@ ari@@ zed and dominated with sel@@ fish politics of domin@@ ance and exclusion , by both men and women ?
Maybe what was missing was not the women only , but the femin@@ ine values of comp@@ as@@ sion , mer@@ cy and inclusion .
Our society needs national dialogue and cons@@ ens@@ us-@@ building more than it needed the elections , which only reinforced pol@@ ari@@ zation and division .
Our society needs the qualitative representation of the femin@@ ine more than it needs the numer@@ ical , quantitative representation of the femin@@ ine .
We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage .
We need to start acting as agents of comp@@ as@@ sion and mer@@ cy .
We need to develop a femin@@ ine dis@@ course that not only hon@@ ors but also impl@@ ements mer@@ cy instead of re@@ ven@@ ge , collaboration instead of competition , inclusion instead of exclusion .
These are the ide@@ als that a war@@ -@@ tor@@ n Libya needs desper@@ ately in order to achieve peace .
For peace has an al@@ chem@@ y , and this al@@ chem@@ y is about the inter@@ tw@@ ining , the altern@@ ation between the femin@@ ine and mas@@ cul@@ ine perspectives .
That &apos;s the real zi@@ pper .
And we need to establish that exist@@ enti@@ ally before we do so soci@@ opoli@@ tically .
According to a Q@@ ur@@ an@@ ic verse &quot; Sal@@ am &quot; -- peace -- &quot; is the word of the all-@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful God , ra@@ he@@ em . &quot;
In turn , the word &quot; ra@@ he@@ em , &quot; which is known in all Ab@@ rah@@ am@@ ic traditions , has the same root in Arab@@ ic as the word &quot; rah@@ em &quot; -- wom@@ b -- symboli@@ zing the mat@@ ernal femin@@ ine encomp@@ ass@@ ing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tri@@ bes , all peoples , have eman@@ ated from .
And so just as the wom@@ b entirely en@@ velop@@ es the em@@ br@@ yo , which grows within it , the di@@ vine mat@@ rix of comp@@ as@@ sion no@@ ur@@ ishes the entire existence .
Thus we are told that &quot; My mer@@ cy encomp@@ asses all things . &quot;
Thus we are told that &quot; My mer@@ cy takes preced@@ ence over my anger . &quot;
May we all be granted a grace of mer@@ cy .
Thank you .
When I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet , and I grew up singing a song called &quot; Nothing To En@@ vy . &quot;
And I was very proud .
In school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il@@ -S@@ ung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the enemies .
Although I often wonder@@ ed about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution , but I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger .
But one day , in 1995 , my mo@@ m brought home a letter from a co@@ worker &apos;s sister .
It read , &quot; When you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven &apos;t e@@ aten for the past two weeks .
We are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . &quot;
I was so sho@@ cked .
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering .
So@@ on after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that I can &apos;t er@@ ase from my memory .
A lifel@@ ess woman was lying on the ground , while an em@@ aci@@ ated child in her arms just star@@ ed hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly at his mother &apos;s face .
But nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
A huge fam@@ ine hit North Korea in the mid-@@ 1990s .
Ultim@@ ately , more than a million North Kor@@ e@@ ans died during the fam@@ ine , and many only survi@@ ved by eating grass , bugs and tree bar@@ k .
Power out@@ ages also became more and more frequent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .
I always wonder@@ ed why they had lights but we didn &apos;t .
This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night compared to neigh@@ b@@ ors .
This is the Am@@ ro@@ k River , which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China .
As you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing North Kor@@ e@@ ans to sec@@ re@@ tly cross .
But many die .
Sometimes , I saw dead bodies flo@@ ating down the river .
I can &apos;t reveal many details &#91; about &#93; how I left North Korea , but I only can say that during the ug@@ ly years of the fam@@ ine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives .
But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time .
I could have never imag@@ ined that it would take 14 years to live together .
In China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee , but I soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants .
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be re@@ patri@@ ated to a hor@@ ri@@ ble fate back in North Korea .
One day , my worst night@@ mare came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation .
Some@@ one had accused me of being North Korean , so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
I was so scar@@ ed , I thought my heart was going to explo@@ de .
If anything seemed un@@ natural , I could be impris@@ oned and re@@ patri@@ ated .
I thought my life was over , but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
After they finished ques@@ tioning me , one official said to another , &quot; This was a false report .
She &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
And they let me go . It was a mi@@ racle .
Some North Kor@@ e@@ ans in China seek asylum in foreign emb@@ assi@@ es , but many can be caught by the Chinese police and re@@ patri@@ ated .
These girls were so lucky .
Even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
These North Kor@@ e@@ ans were not so lucky .
Every year , countless North Kor@@ e@@ ans are caught in China and re@@ patri@@ ated to North Korea , where they can be tor@@ tured , impris@@ oned or publicly executed .
Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Kor@@ e@@ ans have not been so lucky .
It &apos;s tragic that North Kor@@ e@@ ans have to hide their identi@@ ties and struggle so hard just to survive .
Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an instant .
That &apos;s why , after 10 years of hi@@ ding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Korea , and I started a new life yet again .
Sett@@ ling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
English was so important in South Korea , so I had to start learning my third language .
Also , I realized there was a wide gap between North and South .
We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different due to 67 years of division .
I even went through an identity crisis .
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
Where am I from ? Who am I ?
Su@@ ddenly , there was no country I could pro@@ u@@ dly call my own .
Even though adju@@ sting to life in South Korea was not easy , I made a plan .
I started studying for the university entrance ex@@ am .
Just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a sho@@ cking phone call .
The North Korean authorities inter@@ cep@@ ted some money that I sent to my family , and , as a punishment , my family was going to be for@@ ci@@ bly removed to a des@@ ol@@ ate location in the countryside .
They had to get out quickly , so I started planning how to help them escape .
North Kor@@ e@@ ans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
It &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea , so , ir@@ on@@ ically , I took a flight back to China and I headed toward the North Korean border .
Since my family couldn &apos;t speak Chinese , I had to guide them , somehow , through more than 2@@ ,000 miles in China and then into Sou@@ theast Asia .
The journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
One time , our bus was stopped and boar@@ ded by a Chinese police officer .
He took everyone &apos;s I.@@ D. cards , and he started asking them questions .
Since my family couldn &apos;t understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
As the Chinese officer appro@@ ached my family , I impul@@ sively stood up , and I told him that these are de@@ af and dum@@ b people that I was chap@@ er@@ oning .
He looked at me susp@@ ici@@ ously , but lu@@ ck@@ ily he believed me .
We made it all the way to the border of La@@ os , but I had to spend almost all my money to bri@@ be the border gu@@ ards in La@@ os .
But even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and j@@ ailed for illegal border crossing .
After I paid the fine and bri@@ be , my family was released in one month , but soon after , my family was arrested and j@@ ailed again in the capital of La@@ os .
This was one of the lowest points in my life .
I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in j@@ ail just a short distance from the South Korean emb@@ ass@@ y .
I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station , desper@@ ately trying to get my family out , but I didn &apos;t have enough money to pay a bri@@ be or fine anymore .
I lost all hope .
At that moment , I heard one man &apos;s voice ask me , &quot; What &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
I was so surprised that a total stran@@ ger car@@ ed enough to ask .
In my broken English , and with a dic@@ tionary , I explained the situation , and without hes@@ it@@ ating , the man went to the AT@@ M and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Kor@@ e@@ ans to get out of j@@ ail .
I than@@ ked him with all my heart , and I asked him , &quot; Why are you helping me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m helping the North Korean people . &quot;
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
The kind stran@@ ger symboli@@ zed new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kin@@ dness of stran@@ gers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need .
Event@@ ually , after our long journey , my family and I were re@@ united in South Korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
Many North Kor@@ e@@ ans are separated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .
So we can benefit from the international community for education , English language training , job training , and more .
We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside .
I &apos;ve been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help give asp@@ iring North Kor@@ e@@ ans a chance to prosp@@ er with international support .
I &apos;m confident that you will see more and more North Kor@@ e@@ ans succ@@ eed@@ ing all over the world , including the T@@ ED stage .
Thank you .
Today I have just one request .
Please don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Now I &apos;d like to introduce you to my brothers .
Rem@@ i is 22 , t@@ all and very hand@@ some .
He &apos;s spe@@ ech@@ less , but he communic@@ ates joy in a way that some of the best or@@ ators cannot .
Rem@@ i knows what love is .
He shares it un@@ condi@@ tionally and he shares it regardless .
He &apos;s not gre@@ edy . He doesn &apos;t see skin color .
He doesn &apos;t care about religious differences , and get this : He has never told a lie .
When he s@@ ings songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even I could remember , he remin@@ ds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
Sam@@ uel is 16 . He &apos;s t@@ all . He &apos;s very hand@@ some .
He has the most imp@@ ec@@ cable memory .
He has a sel@@ ective one , though .
He doesn &apos;t remember if he st@@ ole my chocolate bar , but he rem@@ embers the year of release for every song on my iPod , convers@@ ations we had when he was four , we@@ eing on my arm on the first ever episode of Tel@@ et@@ ub@@ bi@@ es , and Lady G@@ aga &apos;s birthday .
Don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
But most people don &apos;t agree .
And in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed and mis@@ understood .
But what li@@ fted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- au@@ ti@@ stic and extraordinary .
Now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; au@@ tism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain dis@@ order that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
It mani@@ f@@ ests in each individual differently , hence why Rem@@ i is so different from S@@ am .
And across the world , every 20 minutes , one new person is diagno@@ sed with au@@ tism , and although it &apos;s one of the fast@@ est@@ -@@ growing develop@@ mental dis@@ orders in the world , there is no known cause or cure .
And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered au@@ tism , but I cannot recall a day without it .
I was just three years old when my brother came along , and I was so exc@@ ited that I had a new being in my life .
And after a few months went by , I realized that he was different .
He scre@@ amed a lot .
He didn &apos;t want to play like the other bab@@ ies did , and in fact , he didn &apos;t seem very interested in me whatsoever .
Rem@@ i lived and rei@@ gn@@ ed in his own world , with his own rules , and he found pleasure in the smallest things , like lining up cars around the room and star@@ ing at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between .
And as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
Yet beyond the t@@ ant@@ ru@@ ms and the fru@@ stration and the ne@@ ver-@@ ending hyper@@ activity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudi@@ ce , a human who had never lied .
Extra@@ ordinary .
Now , I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where I &apos;ve wished that they were just like me .
But I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individu@@ ality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I w@@ ouldn &apos;t want to change with norm@@ ality .
Norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
It just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
And if I could communicate just one thing to Rem@@ i and to S@@ am and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
You can be extraordinary .
Because au@@ ti@@ stic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! Everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all hon@@ esty , the pursuit of norm@@ ality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
The chance for great@@ ness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
Please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Thank you .
Do@@ c Ed@@ ger@@ ton inspired us with a@@ we and cur@@ io@@ sity with this photo of a bul@@ let p@@ ier@@ cing through an app@@ le , and exposure just a milli@@ on@@ th of a second .
But now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trilli@@ on frames per second .
I present you a new type of photography , fem@@ to-@@ photography , a new ima@@ ging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
And with that , we can create cameras that can look around cor@@ ners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X-@@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Now if I take a laser poin@@ ter and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ to@@ seconds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of phot@@ ons barely a milli@@ meter wide , and that pack@@ et of phot@@ ons , that bul@@ let , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bul@@ let .
Now , if you take that bul@@ let and take this pack@@ et of phot@@ ons and fire into this bottle , how will those phot@@ ons sh@@ at@@ ter into this bottle ?
How does light look in slow motion ?
Now , the whole event
Now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a n@@ ano@@ second — that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel — but I &apos;m s@@ lowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
But , Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a did not spons@@ or this research .
Now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
So , the pul@@ se enters the bottle , our bul@@ let , with a pack@@ et of phot@@ ons that start traveling through and that start sc@@ atter@@ ing inside .
Some of the light le@@ aks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these ri@@ p@@ ples of waves .
Many of the phot@@ ons eventually reach the cap and then they explo@@ de in various directions .
As you can see , there &apos;s a bub@@ ble of air , and it &apos;s bo@@ unc@@ ing around inside .
Meanwhile , the ri@@ p@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refl@@ ections at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refl@@ ections are focused .
Now , if you take an ordinary bul@@ let and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
A day , a week ? Ac@@ tually , a whole year .
It &apos;ll be a very bor@@ ing movie — — of a slow , ordinary bul@@ let in motion .
And what about some still@@ -@@ life photography ?
You can watch the ri@@ p@@ ples again washing over the table , the tom@@ ato and the wall in the back .
It &apos;s like thro@@ wing a stone in a p@@ ond of water .
I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral com@@ posite .
But if you look at this tom@@ ato one more time , you will notice , as the light wash@@ es over the tom@@ ato , it continues to g@@ low . It doesn &apos;t become dark .
Why is that ? Because the tom@@ ato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is bo@@ unc@@ ing around inside the tom@@ ato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
So , in the future , when this fem@@ to-@@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a super@@ market and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually tou@@ ching it .
So how did my team at M@@ IT create this camera ?
Now , as photograph@@ ers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shor@@ test exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
So , what we do is we send that bul@@ let , those pack@@ et of phot@@ ons , millions of times , and record again and again with very cle@@ ver synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of data , we comp@@ ut@@ ation@@ ally we@@ ave together to create those fem@@ to-@@ videos I showed you .
And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
So , Super@@ man can fly .
Some other her@@ oes can become in@@ visible , but what about a new power for a future super@@ her@@ o : to see around cor@@ ners ?
The idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
It &apos;s going to bo@@ un@@ ce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple bo@@ un@@ ces of light .
And it &apos;s not science fiction . We have actually built it .
On the left , you see our fem@@ to-@@ camera .
There &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bo@@ un@@ ce light off the door .
So after our paper was published in Nature Communications , it was highlighted by Natur@@ e.com , and they created this animation .
We &apos;re going to fire those bul@@ lets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the phot@@ ons , they will sc@@ at@@ ter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ at@@ ter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fra@@ ction of the phot@@ ons will actually come back to the camera , but most interest@@ ingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot .
And because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to-@@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
It has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
And this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
By sh@@ ining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , doz@@ ens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analy@@ ze the multiple bo@@ un@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Can we see it in full 3D ?
So this is our reconstruction .
Now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the l@@ ab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid col@@ li@@ sions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survi@@ vors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ osc@@ opes that can see deep inside the body around occ@@ lu@@ ders , and also for car@@ di@@ osc@@ opes .
But of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to-@@ photography as really a new ima@@ ging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health ima@@ ging problems .
Now , like Do@@ c Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scienti@@ st himself , science became art , an art of ultra-@@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific ima@@ ging , but we can also do a new form of comp@@ ut@@ ational photography with time-@@ lap@@ se and col@@ or-@@ co@@ ding , and we look at those ri@@ p@@ ples . Remember , the time between each of those ri@@ p@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
But there &apos;s also something f@@ unny going on here .
When you look at the ri@@ p@@ ples under the cap , the ri@@ p@@ ples are moving away from us .
The ri@@ p@@ ples should be moving towards us .
What &apos;s going on here ?
It turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Ein@@ stein would have loved to see this picture .
The order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes re@@ vers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distortion .
So whether it &apos;s for photography around cor@@ ners , or creating the next generation of health ima@@ ging , or creating new visu@@ aliz@@ ations , since our inv@@ ention , we have open-@@ sour@@ ced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DI@@ Y , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the meg@@ api@@ xels in cameras — — and start focusing on the next dimension in ima@@ ging .
It &apos;s about time . Thank you .
There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
We don &apos;t b@@ ump into every neigh@@ bor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
So over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neigh@@ b@@ ors in public space , using simple tools like sti@@ ck@@ ers , sten@@ cils and chal@@ k .
And these projects came from questions I had , like , how much are my neigh@@ b@@ ors paying for their apartments ?
How can we lend and bor@@ row more things without kno@@ cking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?
How can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
And how can we share more of our hopes for our vac@@ ant stor@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
Now , I live in New Or@@ le@@ ans , and I am in love with New Or@@ le@@ ans .
My soul is always so@@ oth@@ ed by the giant live o@@ ak trees , sha@@ ding lovers , dr@@ un@@ ks and dre@@ am@@ ers for hundreds of years , and I trust a city that always makes way for music .
I feel like every time someone s@@ ne@@ e@@ zes , New Or@@ le@@ ans has a par@@ ade .
The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America .
I live near this house , and I thought about how I could make it a nic@@ er space for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that changed my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost someone I loved very much .
Her name was Jo@@ an , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .
And I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .
But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
I feel like it &apos;s easy to get caught up in the day-to-@@ day , and forget what really matters to you .
So with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chal@@ k@@ board and sten@@ c@@ iled it with a f@@ ill@@ -in-@@ the-@@ blan@@ k sentence : &quot; Before I die , I want to ... &quot; So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chal@@ k , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
And I &apos;d like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
&quot; Before I die , I want to be tried for pi@@ racy . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to stra@@ ddle the International Date Line . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to sing for millions . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to plant a tree . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to live off the grid . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to hold her one more time . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be someone &apos;s c@@ av@@ al@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
So this negl@@ ected space became a constructive one , and people &apos;s hopes and dreams made me lau@@ gh out loud , te@@ ar up , and they con@@ sol@@ ed me during my own tough times .
It &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .
It &apos;s about understanding our neigh@@ b@@ ors in new and en@@ ligh@@ tening ways .
It &apos;s about making space for reflection and contem@@ pl@@ ation , and remember@@ ing what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
I made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passion@@ ate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civi@@ c center colleagues and I made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including Kaz@@ ak@@ h@@ stan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
Together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
In our age of increasing di@@ stra@@ c@@ tions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
De@@ ath is something that we &apos;re often dis@@ cour@@ aged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most em@@ power@@ ing things you can do .
Th@@ in@@ king about death clari@@ fies your life .
Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So , well , I do applied math , and this is a pec@@ uli@@ ar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
No one knows what the hell we do .
So I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
So , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
We delight at bal@@ let virtu@@ o@@ sos and t@@ ap dan@@ c@@ ers you will see later on .
Now , bal@@ let requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial su@@ it@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Now , s@@ adly , neur@@ ological dis@@ orders such as Park@@ inson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend Jan Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ o@@ so bal@@ let dan@@ c@@ er in his time .
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
However , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with inc@@ ur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
We need to be able to measure progres@@ sion obj@@ ectively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
But frustr@@ at@@ ingly , with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease and other movement dis@@ orders , there are no biom@@ ark@@ ers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20-@@ minute neur@@ ologist test .
You have to go to the clin@@ ic to do it . It &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . It &apos;s never done .
But what if patients could do this test at home ?
Now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clin@@ ic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
No expensive staff time required .
T@@ akes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neur@@ ologist &apos;s clin@@ ic to do it .
So what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ o@@ sos like my friend Jan Stri@@ pling .
So here we have a video of the vibr@@ ating vocal fol@@ ds .
Now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal bal@@ let dan@@ c@@ ers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . Fo@@ x@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
And like bal@@ let , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
From the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the lim@@ bs are affected in Park@@ inson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
So on the bottom trace , you can see an example of ir@@ regular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
We see all the same symptoms .
We see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
The speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more breath@@ y after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
So these vocal effects can actually be quite sub@@ tle , in some cases , but with any digital micro@@ phone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continu@@ um between health and disease using voice signals alone .
So these voic@@ e-@@ based tests , how do they st@@ ack up against expert clinical tests ? We &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non-@@ inv@@ asi@@ ve .
The neur@@ ologist &apos;s test is non-@@ inv@@ asi@@ ve . They both use existing infrastructure .
You don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
And they &apos;re both accurate . Ok@@ ay , but in addition , voic@@ e-@@ based tests are non-@@ expert .
That means they can be self-@@ administ@@ ered .
They &apos;re high-speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
They &apos;re ultra-@@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
When something becomes ultra-@@ low cost , it becomes massi@@ vely sc@@ al@@ able .
So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
We can reduce log@@ is@@ tical difficulties with patients .
No need to go to the clin@@ ic for a routine check@@ up .
We can do high-@@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
We can perform low-@@ cost mass recruitment for clinical trials , and we can make popul@@ ation-@@ scale screening feasible for the first time .
We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ark@@ ers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
So , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Park@@ inson &apos;s Vo@@ ice Initiative .
With A@@ cul@@ ab and Pati@@ ent@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
We have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Anyone healthy or with Park@@ inson &apos;s can call in , che@@ ap@@ ly , and leave recordings , a few c@@ ents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Thank you .
So Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
What are you going to get out of those samples ?
Y@@ e@@ ah . Y@@ e@@ ah . So what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . Right .
You see , some people may not do it . They may not get through it .
But we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual mark@@ ers of the disease .
So you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
It &apos;s much better than that .
Ac@@ tually , my student Th@@ an@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ nine . Well , that &apos;s an improvement .
So what that means is that people will be able to — People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Park@@ inson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Absol@@ utely .
Thanks so much . Max Little , everybody .
Thanks , Tom .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi National Park .
Those are my dad &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi National Park .
Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi National Park is not f@@ enced in the south widely , which means wild animals like z@@ eb@@ ras migr@@ ate out of the park freely .
So pre@@ dat@@ ors like li@@ ons follow them , and this is what they do .
They kill our livestock .
This is one of the co@@ ws which was killed at night , and I just wo@@ ke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bul@@ l we had .
My community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heav@@ en with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
So I grew up h@@ ating li@@ ons so much .
The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem .
So they kill the li@@ ons .
It &apos;s one of the six li@@ ons which were killed in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi .
And I think this is why the Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi National Park li@@ ons are few .
So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought li@@ ons were scar@@ ed of fire .
But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the li@@ ons to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
And a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
I was trying to tri@@ ck the li@@ ons &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
But li@@ ons are very cle@@ ver .
They will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
So he j@@ umps in and k@@ ills the animals .
So one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a tor@@ ch , and that day , the li@@ ons didn &apos;t come .
And I discovered that li@@ ons are afraid of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mo@@ m &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motor@@ cycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . It b@@ links .
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
And that &apos;s a small tor@@ ch from a broken f@@ las@@ h@@ light .
So I set up everything .
As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
As you can see , the bul@@ bs face outside , because that &apos;s where the li@@ ons come from .
And that &apos;s how it looks to li@@ ons when they come at night .
The lights flash and tri@@ ck the li@@ ons into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
Thanks .
So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with li@@ ons .
And my neighbor@@ ing homes heard about this idea .
One of them was this grand@@ mother .
She had a lot of her animals being killed by li@@ ons , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other pre@@ dat@@ ors like hy@@ en@@ as , le@@ op@@ ards , and it &apos;s also being used to sc@@ are el@@ eph@@ ants away from people &apos;s farms .
Because of this inv@@ ention , I was lucky to get a schol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , and I &apos;m really exc@@ ited about this .
My new school now is coming in and helping by fund@@ raising and creating an awareness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
So one year ago , I was just a boy in the sav@@ anna grass@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
And here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for T@@ ED .
So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
I used to h@@ ate li@@ ons , but now because my inv@@ ention is saving my father &apos;s co@@ ws and the li@@ ons , we are able to stay with the li@@ ons without any conflict .
Ash@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my language , thank you very much .
You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
So you got this schol@@ ar@@ ship . Y@@ ep .
You &apos;re working on other electrical inven@@ tions .
What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
My next inv@@ ention is , I want to make an electric f@@ ence . Electri@@ c f@@ ence ?
But I know electric f@@ ences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
You already tried it once , right , and you -- I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock .
In the tr@@ en@@ ches . Richard Tur@@ ere , you are something else .
We &apos;re going to che@@ er you on every step of the way , my friend .
Thank you so much . Thank you .
Phot@@ ography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 most treas@@ ured photos of mine , and I didn &apos;t take any of them .
There were no art directors , no sty@@ lists , no chance for res@@ ho@@ ots , not even any regard for lighting .
In fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . We &apos;re on the corner of 5@@ 7th and 5th .
We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Well you can see where this is going .
Appro@@ aching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; H@@ ey , why don &apos;t you take Sab@@ ina back to New York and make it a fa@@ ther@@ -@@ daughter trip , and continue the rit@@ ual ? &quot;
This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
You know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gest@@ ure is of hand@@ ing your camera to a total stran@@ ger .
No one &apos;s ever refused , and lu@@ ck@@ ily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
Back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
It &apos;s really become sac@@ red to us .
This one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five-@@ year-old could understand .
So these photos are far more than pro@@ x@@ ies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
They &apos;re also ways for us to free@@ ze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physi@@ cally , but in every way .
Because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new mil@@ est@@ ones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she inter@@ acts with and sees everything .
This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cher@@ ish and anticip@@ ate the entire year .
Recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red aw@@ ning of the d@@ oll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-@@ year-old standing in that exact spot .
She said she rem@@ embers her heart bur@@ sting out of her ch@@ est when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
And now what she &apos;s looking at in New York are coll@@ eg@@ es , because she &apos;s determined to go to school in New York .
And it hit me : One of the most important things we all make are memories .
So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consci@@ ously creating memories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , I &apos;m not in many of the family photos .
I &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t hesitate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; Will you take our picture ? &quot;
Thank you .
